     &mdash;"Many, whose sequester'd lot
     Forbids their interference, looking on,
     Anticipate perforce some dire event;
     And, seeing the old castle of the state,
     That promis'd once more firmness, so assail'd,
     That all its tempest-beaten turrets shake,
     Stand motionless expectants of its fall."

    WHEN the righteous are in authority, the people
    rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the
    people mourn. <i>Prov. xxix. 2.</i>

    By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make
    the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the
    arm of the mighty. <i>Job, xxxv. 9.</i>

    If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are
    wicked. <i>Prov. xxix. 12.</i>

    The wicked walk on every side when the vilest men
    are exalted. <i>Psalm xii. 8.</i>

    They are exalted for a little while, but they are
    gone and brought low: they are taken out of the way
    as all other, and cut off as the tops of green corn.
    <i>Job, xxiv. 24.</i>

    A righteous man falling down before the wicked is
    as a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring. <i>Prov.

   <i>This Hymn following may be used; one Verse by the
   Priest, and another by the Clerk and People.</i>

    O GIVE thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious:
    and his mercy endureth for ever. <i>Psalm cvii. 1.

   Let them give thanks whom the Lord hath redeemed:
   and delivered from the hand of the enemy. Verse 2.</i>

    Many a time have they fought against me from my
    youth up. <i>Psalm cxxix. 1.</i>

   <i>Yea, many a time have they vexed me from my youth
   up: but they have not prevailed against me. Verse 2.</i>

    They have privily laid their net to destroy me
    without a cause: yea, even without a cause have they
    made a pit for my soul. <i>Psalm xxxv. 7.</i>

    <i>They have laid a net for my feet, and pressed down my
    soul: they have digged a pit before me, and are fallen
    into the midst of it themselves. Psalm lvii. 7.</i>

    Great is our Lord, and great is his power: yea,
    and his wisdom is infinite. <i>Psalm cxlvii. 5.</i>

    <i>The Lord setteth up the meek: and bringeth the un-
    godly down to the ground. Verse 6.</i>

   <i>Two Psalms appointed in the Book of Common Prayer

   to be said on the 29th of each month throughout the year.</i>

   PSALM CXL. <i>Eripe me, Domine.</i>.

   DELIVER me, O Lord, from the evil man: and
   preserve me from the wicked man.

    2 Who imagine mischief in their hearts: and stir
    up strife all the day long.

    3 They have sharpened their tongues like a ser-
    pent: adders' poison is under their lips.

    4 Keep me, O Lord, from the hands of the un-
    godly: preserve me from the wicked men, who are
    purposed to overthrow my goings.

    5 The proud have laid a snare for me, and spread
    a net abroad with cords: yea, and set traps in my
    way.

    6 I said unto the Lord, Thou art my God: hear
    the voice of my prayers, O Lord.

    7 O Lord God, thou strength of my health: thou
    hast covered my head in the day of battle.

    8 Let not the ungodly have his desire, O Lord:
    let not his mischievous imagination prosper, lest they
    be too proud.

    9 Let the mischief of their own lips fall upon the
    head of them: that compass me about.

    10 Let hot burning coals fall upon them: let them
    be cast into the fire, and into the pit, that they never
    rise up again.

    11 A man full of words shall not prosper upon the
    earth: evil shall hunt the wicked person to overthrow
    him.

    12 Sure I am that the Lord will avenge the poor:
    and maintain the cause of the helpless.

    IS The righteous also shall give thanks unto thy
    Name: and the just shall continue in thy sight.

   PSALM CXLI. <i>Domine clamavi.</i>

    LORD, I call upon thee, haste thee unto me and
    consider my voice when I cry unto thee.

    2 Let my prayer be set forth in thy sight as the
    incense: and let the lifting up of my hands be an
    evening sacrifice.

    3 Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth: and
    keep the door of my lips.

    4 O let not mine heart be inclined to any evil
    thing: let me not be occupied in ungodly works with
    the men that work wickedness, lest I eat of such
    things as please them.

      5 Let the righteous rather smite me friendly: and
    reprove me.

      6 But let not their precious balms break my head:
    yea, I will pray yet against their wickedness.

      7 Let their judges be overthrown in stony places:
    that they may hear my words, for they are sweet.

      8 Our bones lie scattered before the pit: like as
    when one breaketh and hevveth wood upon the earth.

      9 But mine eyes look unto thee, O Lord God: in
    thee is my trust, O cast not out my soul.

      10 Keep me from the snare that they have laid for
    me: and from the traps of the wicked doers.

      11 Let the ungodly fall into their own nets toge-
    ther: and let me ever escape them.

   <i>The Suffrages may be as followeth.</i>

      Priest. O Lord, save the Queen.

      People. Who putteth her trust in thee.

      Priest. Send her help from thy holy place.

      People. And evermore mightily defend her.

      Priest. Let her enemies have no advantage against
    her.

   People. Let not the wicked approach to hurt her.

   <i>After the Collects</i> [for Peace and Deliverance from
   our Enemies] <i>may be said that which followeth.</i>

    ALMIGHTY God and heavenly Father, who of thy
    gracious providence, and tender mercy towards
    us, didst prevent the malice and imaginations of our
    enemies, by discovering and confounding their horrible
    and wicked Enterprize, plotted and intended to have
    been executed against the Queen and the whole State
    of <i>England</i>, for the subversion of the Government
    and Religion established among us; and didst like-
    wise wonderfully conduct thy Servant Queen <i>Caroline</i>,
   and bring her safely into <i>England</i>, and preserve us
   from the attempts of our enemies to bereave us of our
   religion and laws: We most humbly praise and mag-
   nify thy most glorious Name for thy unspeakable
   goodness towards us, expressed in both these acts of
   thy mercy. Let the consideration of this thy re-
   peated goodness, O Lord, work in us true repentance,
   that iniquity may not be our ruin. And increase in
   us more and more a lively faith and love, fruitful in
   all holy obedience; that thou mayest still continue
   thy favour, with the light of thy Gospel, to us and

    The wicked are like the troubled sea, when it can-
    not rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt. <i>Isa</i>. lvii.
    29.

   Take away the wicked from before the king, and
   his throne shall be established in righteousness. <i>Prov.</i>-
   xxv. 5.

   When it goeth well with the righteous, the city
   rejoiceth: and when the wicked perish, there is
   shouting. <i>Prov</i>. xi. 10.

   A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he
   that speaketh lies shall not escape. <i>Prov</i>. ix. 5.

   Great men are not always wise: neither do the
   aged understand judgment. <i>Job</i>, xxxii. 9.

    For the transgression of a land, many are the princes
    thereof: but by a man of understanding and know-
    ledge, the state thereof shall be prolonged. <i>Prov.</i>
    xxviii. 2.

   As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; so is a
   wicked ruler over the poor people. <i>Prov.</i> xxviii. 15.

   Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and
   foolish king, who will no more be admonished. <i>Eccl</i>.
   iv. 13.

    His bones are full of the sins of his youth, which
    shall lie down with him in the dust. <i>Job</i>, xx. 11.

   Be wise now therefore O ye kings; be instructed
   ye judges of the earth. <i>Psalm</i> ii. 10.

    <h3>
      CROSS EXAMINED BY MR. BESOM.
    </h3>
    <p>
      WHO <span class="pagenum"><a name="link071" id="link071"></a><a
      href="../44520-page-images/p071.jpg">071</a></span>are you? Non mi
      ricordo.
    </p>
    <p>
      What countryman are you?&mdash;a foreigner or an englishman? Non mi
      ricordo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you <i>understand</i> English? No not at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Will the Oath you have taken <i>bind</i> you to speak the truth, or do you
      know of any other Oath <i>more</i> binding?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Turnstile General objected to the ques-tion; upon which a discussion
      arose as to the nature of the Oath likely to bind the Witness, who
      ap-peared to be playing with a thread. The Witness was accordingly asked,
      by way of illustration, to what degree he thought the thread was <i>binding</i>,
      and whether he knew of any thing else <i>more</i> binding?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lord Precedent Furthermore said, if the Witness believed the thread he
      held was <i>binding</i>, that was sufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lord Precedents opinion gave rise to a long discussion as to whether
      <i>more</i> binding was <i>binding</i>, and binding was <i>more</i>
      binding; which ended in a reference to the Erminians, who delivered the
      following solemn opinion:&mdash;If the Witness shall answer that he thinks
      the bit of thread is <i>binding</i>, there is no doubt it <i>is</i>
      binding; but he cannot be asked if a cord is <i>more</i> binding, because
      he in fact says <span class="pagenum"><a name="link072" id="link072"></a><a
      href="../44520-page-images/p072.jpg">072</a></span>that the thread itself
      is <i>binding</i>. If the Witness twists the thread round his little
      finger he is so far bound by it, and it is <i>binding</i>; and having done
      that, it is unnecessary to inquire whether a cord, round another part of
      his body, would be <i>more</i> binding.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are a master tailor, I think? I was cut out for a tailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have been a tailor, then? I only follow tailoring as a mere amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fond of <i>Goose</i> I suppose&mdash;but pray Mr. Mere-amusement what is
      your business? I was brought up a <i>Cabinet</i> maker.
    </p>
    <p>
      What can you get at it?&mdash;are you a good hand? I can't say I am; I'm
      badly off; my <i>tools</i> are worn out.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is your place of residence?
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Order Order</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Turnstile General protested against the consequences of this mode of
      Examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Juryman&mdash;Why does not the Interpreter give the Witness's Answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lord Precedent Furthermore&mdash;Because the Bench objects to the
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord MUDDLEPOOL&mdash;Does the Turnstile General object to the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Turnstile General. I do object to it, my Lord. This is perhaps the
      most important question that ever occurred. By this dealing out, the party
      is placed in such a situation as he never was placed in before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. <span class="pagenum"><a name="link073" id="link073"></a><a
      href="../44520-page-images/p073.jpg">073</a></span>Besom&mdash;I ask him
      where he now lives, and the Turnstile General objects to this, because I
      do not put all the questions I might put, in a single breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lord Precedent Furthermore&mdash;I feel great difficulty&mdash;I
      doubt..
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Wheelbarrow thought there was a <i>great</i> deal in what the noble
      Lord had said; and <i>he</i> doubted.

      CROSS EXAMINATION RESUMED.
    </h3>
    <p>
      How much money has been expended on you since you were born? Non mi
      ricordo.
    </p>
    <p>
      What have you done for it in return? More less than more.
    </p>
    <p>
      How do you get your living? I was waiter for some years at the Hotel <i>de
      Grand Bretagne</i>, and succeeded my father as head waiter at the <i>Crown</i>
      Inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      What wages have you? Non mi ricordo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have you any perquisites? <i>Veils</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Are you <i>head waiter</i>, or by what other name than head waiter you may
      be called, at the Crown Inn?
    </p>
    <p>
      I am after building a new place called the <i>Wellington Arms</i>, and
      trying to be <i>Barrack-master</i>; if I dont gain the <i>Trial</i> I
      shall be glad to remain at the old <i>Crown</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This answer appeared to excite considerable sensation,
    </p>
    <p>
      The Twister General thought the meaning was,
    </p>
    <p>
      'if I do n't gain what I attempt to gain.'
    </p>
    <p>
      [The Short-hand writer was desired to read the answer, and the word <i>Trial</i>
      was retained as the correct translation.]
    </p>
    <p>
      I <span class="pagenum"><a name="link074" id="link074"></a><a
      href="../44520-page-images/p074.jpg">074</a></span>do not ask what you are
      to be hereafter, but whether you are <i>still</i> head waiter at the
      Crown?
    </p>
    <p>
      The head waiter is dismissed occasionally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Are you married? More yes than no.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you live with your own wife? No.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is she in this country? Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why did you marry? To pay my debts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then why did you part? Because my debts were paid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Were you not up to the eyes in debt? Si Signor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Are you not bound to manifest some gratitude towards those who have paid
      your debts?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Interpreter said the witness was a mere <i>fanfaron</i>, and that he
      found it difficult, if not impossible, to explain to the witness's
      understanding what was meant by <i>gratitude</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cross Examination resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did not you write to your wife a licentious letter, called a letter of
      license?&mdash;(<i>Order, order.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      I ask you again the cause of your separation?
    </p>
    <p>
      She left me.
    </p>
    <p>
      On what account? I did not like her, and I told her I'd have nothing to do
      with <i>her</i> any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that what did you do? Oh, I rambled about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where did you go? To Jersey and elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, Sir, go on. Non mi ricordo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you mean to say that you never went to Manchester Square? More yes than
      no.
    </p>
    <p>
      Were you in the house on the footing of a private friend? No, not as a
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      You <span class="pagenum"><a name="link075" id="link075"></a><a
      href="../44520-page-images/p075.jpg">075</a></span>mentioned your father
      just now:&mdash;you did not go in your father's <i>cart</i>, I presume; in
      what sort of carriage did you go? In the old yellow chariot.
    </p>
    <p>
      How long did it take you to travel from Manchester Square to Richmond? Non
      mi ricordo.
    </p>
    <p>
      How many other places did you go to? Non mi ricordo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is the Marquis of C. a married man?

    <p>
      (<i>Order. Order.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      After you parted from your wife, on what terms did you live? I've been <i>trying</i>
      to get rid of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you know what Matthew says (c. v. v. 32.)?
    </p>
    <p>
      Matthew? Matthew? (<i>trying to recollect</i>)&mdash;what Matthew?&mdash;he's
      no friend of mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      In what light do you consider your oath at the marriage ceremony? A
      ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your marriage oath has not bound you, can you expect people to believe
      you if ever you should take a solemn public oath? More yes than no.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the Roman law, a divorce was granted for Drunkenness, Adultery, and <i>False
      Keys</i>: what is your opinion of that law?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Twister General said, that it was contrary to common sense to ask the
      witness's opinion about any <i>Law</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      How many Wives does <i>your</i> Church allow you? Non mi ricordo.
    </p>
    <p>
      How many have you had since you separated from your own? Non mi ricordo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Are you a Member of the Society for the Suppression of Vice? Yes (<i>with
      great energy</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cross-examining Counsel said that the Interpreter had materially
      altered the sense of the last question; <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link076" id="link076"></a><a href="../44520-page-images/p076.jpg">076</a></span>he
      had in fact asked, if the Witness was Member of the Society for the
      suppression of <i>Wives, (a loud laugh)</i> which Witness had eagerly
      answered in the affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Witness's answer was expunged, and on the question being repeated
      correctly, he answered that he was told it was his duty to encourage the
      <i>Vice</i> Society, because it professed to diminish the influence of bad
      example.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have they ever prosecuted you? Me!&mdash;(<i>with astonishment</i>)&mdash;they
      like <i>me</i> too well!
    </p>
    <p>
      What do you mean then by Suppression&mdash;is your Soeiety to prevent
      little vice from being committed, or great vice from being found out?
    </p>
    <p>
      More Yes than No.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was here moved by Lord Le Cuisinier, that 4 o'Clock, the hour of
      dinner, was arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another, in a maiden Speeeh, said, that during his long silence in that
      Court he had had leisure to observe, that 4 o'Clock in the <i>morning</i>
      was a more usual hour of adjournment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another considered that Lord Le Cuisinier's suggestion ought not to be
      entertained for a moment. We only exist in our formalities. If we suffer
      ourselves to be put a stop to by the motion, we may find that we are
      travelling round again into the obsolete usages of our early ancestors;
      which will be to describe a circle that must be generally considered as
      nothing less than a revolution! I therefore deprecate the least
      innovation, and move, as an amendment, that 4 o'Clock is <i>not</i>
      arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="pagenum"><a name="link077" id="link077"></a><a
      href="../44520-page-images/p077.jpg">077</a></span>Master General of the
      <i>Black</i> Barracks at Exeter, rose without his wig, and declaring, upon
      the memory of his whiskers, that he had just heard it strike 4, he
      enquired whether the Clock was in <i>Order. (Loud and continued cries of
      hear hear.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Home DOCTOR felt his pulse alarmingly quicken one and a fraction in
      the minute, and nervously said, that the clock was clearly guilty of a
      barefaced libel and ought to be instantly held to bail for breach of the
      peace. The simultaneous action of all the Clocks throughout the nation and
      their open communication by circulars, was an index to the existence of an
      organized correspondence and a systematic affiliation. He trembled at the
      positive intelligence he had received, that millions at that moment held
      their hands in an attitude ready to strike; but it was the proudest day of
      his life that he had so far succeeded by a <i>circular</i> movement of his
      own, as to enable his workmen to hold them to the peace for an hour
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Bathos assured the Black-Barrack Master-General that the Clock <i>was</i>
      out of Order, and he congratulated the Home Doctor on his efficiency; but
      he thought they had not sunk low enough into the subject; for he had
      strong doubts whether the striking might not be construed into an overt
      act of High Treason, and if he saw any probability of being supported he
      should conclude with a substantive motion. Did not the Lord Precedent
      remember a Clock Case, in which, immediately after the chain had been
      locked up, a principal link suddenly disappeared? and whether, after the
      most minute inquiry, there was not every reason to believe from the best
      information that could be obtained at that time, <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link078" id="link078"></a><a href="../44520-page-images/p078.jpg">078</a></span>that
      that link had been <i>prigged? (Hear hear.)</i> Take even the very last
      Clock Case, where the chain was kept together with the greatest pains, and
      the utmost care. If the smallest link in that chain had been <i>prigged</i>,
      it would have been fatal to the works, and yet in that very case, two days
      after the chain was locked up, a link was obtained, which, if sooner
      discovered, would have lengthened the chain to the necessary extent, and
      brought home in the most conclusive manner the guilt of the Clock. He
      therefore moved that the Clock be examined, and the chain kept in their
      own custody, with liberty to add to the number of links.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Ratstail with his usual animation seconded the Motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marquiz Boudoir moved as an Amendment, that the Clock being in contempt,
      the <i>Black stick</i> be ordered to <i>walk him</i> in to-morrow.
      Seconded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this Amendment the following Amendment was moved and seconded, that
      the word 'to-morrow' be expunged, and the word 'yesterday' be inserted in
      its place. <i>Ordered.</i>

      Examination was nearly concluded? <i>(Cries of Keep on!)</i>&mdash;Supposing
      that the business would close to day at 4 o'clock, he had made a private

      consulting with his Wife upon a motion-of-course which they had
      contemplated; and their further deliberation had been postponed until
      after the adjournment to-day. It was impossible to know what questions
      might turnout to be doubtful or doubtless; yet adjourning at Five o'Clock
      would gain a delay of six hours in the Week, and the <i>gaining of any
      thing</i> he considered very material in the present case.

      have caused to be published and promulgated throughout the Nation a

      decorum forbids the mention; and also gross and inflaming allusions to the
      intercourse between the sexes, and wanton and shocking exposures relating
      thereto; to the destruction of youthful innocence, to the shame and
      disgust of matron modesty, and to the horror of all heads of families: it
      is therefore proposed to call an immediate MEETING, for the purpose of
      considering the best mode of preventing an increase of this dreadful

      bringing them to condign punishment.

      href="../44520-page-images/p083.jpg">083</a></span>Infirm Elderly
      Gentleman in a Public Office, lately left his home, just after dreadfully
      ill-using his wife about half a Crown, and trying to beat her. He had long
      complained a great deal of his forehead, and lately had a leech put upon
      him. He was last seen walking swiftly towards the Horns without a Crown to
      his hat, accompanied by some evil disposed persons, who tied a great green
      bag to his tail full of crackers, which he mistook for sweetmeats, and
      burnt himself dreadfully. Every person he met in this deplorable condition
      tried to persuade him to go back, but in vain. He is very deaf and very
      obstinate, and cannot bear to be looked at or spoken to. It is supposed
      that he has been seduced and carried off by some artful female. He may be
      easily known by his manners. He fancies himself the politest man in
      Europe, because he knows how to bow, and to offer a pinch of snuff; and
      thinks himself the greatest man in Europe, because people have humoured
      him and let him have his own way. He is so fond of tailoring, that he
      lately began a suit that will take him his life to complete. He delights
      in playing at soldiers, supposes himself a cavalry officer, and makes
      speeches, that others write for him, in a field marshal's uniform.
      Sometimes he fancies himself 'Glorious Apollo,' plays;Hailstones of
      Brunswick' on the base fiddle, and qualifies his frieuds to perform
      'Cuckolds all on a row.' His concerns are very much deranged. Not long ago
      he imported a vast quantity of Italian images at enormous prices, upon
      credit, and hoarded them up in a waterside cotton warehouse. Since then,
      things have gone all against him, and he has been in a very desponding
      state. It is of the utmost consequence to himself that he should be at his
      post, or he may lose his place; one of his predecessors some time ago
      having been cashiered for his misconduct. If this should meet his eye, it
      is earnestly requested that he will return to his duty, and he will be
      kindly received and no questions asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      N. B. He has not a friend in the world except the advertiser and a few
      others, who never had an opportunity of speaking to him and letting him
      know the real state of his affairs.

      PUBLIC OFFICE, LUDGATE HILL.
    </h3>
    <p>
      1st September, 1820. "WHEREAS <span class="pagenum"><a name="link084"
      id="link084"></a> <a href="../44520-page-images/p084.jpg">084</a></span>that
      well known old established Public House, (formerly a <i>free</i> house)
      called the Political House that Jack built, has been feloniously entered
      into and damaged, and the property therein carried off to a large amount,
      by a numerous gang of desperate Villains, who, by various vile arts and
      contrivances, have not only kept possession thereof, but also of the Head
      Waiter, who was intrusted by Mr. Bull, the owner, with the management of
      the concern, and was a very promising young man when Mr. Bull first knew
      him, and might have done very well if he had followed the advice of his
      old friends, and not suffered these desperadoes to get him into their
      clutches; since when he seems to have forgotten himself, and by neglecting
      his duty sadly, and behaving ill to the customers who support the House,
      has almost ruined the Business, and has also dreadfully injured the Sign,
      which Mr. Bull had had fresh painted after he dismissed a former waiter
      for his bad manners. Whoever will assist Mr. Bull in bringing the
      offenders to Justice, will be doing a great service to the young man, and
      he will still be retained in his situation, unless he has actually
      destroyed or made away with the Sign, which Mr. Bull very much admires, it
      being a <i>heir-loom</i>. If offered to be pawned or sold it is requested
      the parties may be stopped, and notice given as above. As the young man
      has not been seen for some time, there is no doubt the ruffians have
      either done him a serious mischief, or secreted him somewhere to prevent
      Mr. Bull, who is really his friend, from speaking to him.

    <p>
      Please to walk in, Ladies and Gentlemen&mdash;it's well worth seeing! here
      are the most wonderful of all wonderful Living Animals. 'Jake care! Don't
      go within their reach-they mind nobody but me! A short time ago they got
      loose, and, with some other vermin that came from their holes and corners,
      desperately attacked a Lady of Quality; but, as luck would have it, I, and
      my (four and twenty men,' happened to come in at the very moment;&mdash;we
      'pull'd' away, and prevented'em from doing her a serious mischief. Though
      they look tame, their vicious dispositions are unchanged. If any thing was
      to happen to me, they'd soon break out again, and shew their natural
      ferocity, i'm in continual danger from'em myself&mdash;for if I didn't
      watch'em closely they'd destroy me. As the clown says, 'there never was
      such times,'&mdash;so there's no telling what tricks they may play yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ladies and Gentlemen,&mdash;these animals have been exhibited at Court,
      before the King, and all the Royal Family! Indeed His Majesty is so fond
      of'em that he often sees'em in private, and feeds'em; and he is so
      diverted by'em that he has been pleased to express his gracious
      approbation of all their motions. But they're as cunning as the old one
      himself! Bless you, he does not know a thousandth part of their tricks.
      You, Ladies and Gentlemen, may see'em just as they are!&mdash;the Beasts

    <p>
      Ladies and Gentlemen,
    </p>
    <p>
      I begin the Exhibition with the Crocodile, which is of the Lizard tribe ;
      yet, from his <i>facility of creeping through narrow and intricate ways,</i>
      he has been classed among Serpents. * He has a monstrous appetite, his <i>swallow</i>
      is immense, and his legs are placed <i>side</i>-ways. It is a vulgar error
      to suppose that he cannot <i>turn</i>; for, although he is in appearance
      very heavy, and his back is very strong, and proof against the hardest
      blows, yet he is so <i>pliable</i>, that he can <i>wheel</i> round with
      the utmost facility. When in his haunt, and apparently torpid, he
      sometimes utters a piteous <i>whine</i> of distress&mdash;almost human; <i>sheds
      tears</i>, and, attracting the unwary, suddenly darts upon a man, and
      gorges him with all he has. His <i>claws</i> are very long and tenacious.
      If a victim eludes his grasp, he infallibly secures him by his fleet
      power. He is sometimes used for purposes of <i>state and show</i>, and his
      bags are much coveted for their <i>peculiar</i> qualities. **

    <p>
      Ladies and Gentlemen,
    </p>
    <p>
      The Locust is a destructive insect, of the Grillus tribe. They are so
      numerous, and so rapacious, that they may be compared to an army, pursuing
      its march to devour the fruits of the earth, as an instrument of <i>divine
      displeasure</i> towards a devoted country. They have leaders, who direct
      their motions in preying on the labours of man <i>in fertile regions</i>.
      No insect is more formidable in places where they breed: for they <i>wither</i>
      whatever they <i>touch</i>. It is impossible to recount the <i>terrible
      devastations</i> which historians and travellers relate that they have
      committed at different times, in various parts of the world. Many are so
      <i>venomous</i>, that persons <i>handling</i> them are immediately stung,
      and seized with shivering and trembling; but it has been discovered that,
      in most cases, their hateful qualities are completely assuaged by <i>palm</i>
      oil.*

      A SCORPION.

    <p>
      Ladies and Gentlemen,
    </p>
    <p>
      The Scorpion is a reptile that resembles the <i>common lobster</i>, but is
      much more hideous. They are very terrible to mankind, on account of their
      size and malignity, and their large <i>crooked stings</i>. They often
      assault and kill people in their houses. In Italy, and some other parts of
      Europe, they are the greatest pests of mankind; but their venom is most
      dreadful in the <i>East</i>. An inferior species sally forth at certain
      seasons, in battalions;&mdash;scale houses that stand in the way of their
      march;&mdash;wind along the course of rivers;&mdash;and on their retreat
      entrench themselves. Scorpions are so irascible, that they will attempt to
      sting a <i>constable's staff</i>; yet even a harmless little mouse *
      destroyed three of them, <i>one after the other</i>, by acting on the <i>defensive</i>,
      survived their venomous wounds, and seemed pleased with its victory. When
      in a confined space, they exert all their rage against each other, and
      there is nothing to be seen but universal carnage. If this mutual
      destruction did not prevail, they would multiply so fast as to render some
      countries uninhabitable. **

      The Lobster is very similar to the scorpion. It is <i>armed</i> with <i>two</i>
      great <i>claws</i>, by the help of which it moves itself <i>forwards</i>.
      They <i>entrench</i> themselves in places that can be easily defended,
      where they acquire defensive and offensive <i>armour</i>. They issue forth
      from their <i>fortresses</i> in hope of <i>plunder</i>, and to surprise
      such inadvertent and weak animals as come within their reach. They have
      little to apprehend except from each other, the more powerful being
      formidable enemies to the weaker. They sometimes continue in the same
      habitations for a long time together; in general they get <i>new coats
      once a year</i>. When in <i>hot water</i> they make a great noise, attack
      any one that puts a hand towards them, and knowing their danger, use
      violent efforts to escape. In a sufficient heat they <i>change their
      colours</i>.*

      THE OPOSSUM.

    <p>
      Ladies and Gentlemen,
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a <i>quick climbing</i> animal; but is, in other respects, <i>heavy</i>
      and helpless. When it is pursued on <i>level ground</i> and overtaken, it
      feigns itself dead, to deceive the hunters. A faculty in its <i>seat</i>,
      enables it to suspend itself from a high branch, by that part, for a long
      time together; and, in this position, watching for whatever is weak that
      comes within its reach, it falls upon it and usually destroys it. By this
      elevating power in its <i>nether end</i>, it not only seizes its prey more
      securely, but preserves itself from pursuers: looking down on them, in a
      sort of <i>upright</i> position, heels upwards. It is very domesticated,
      but proves a disagreeable inmate, from its <i>scent</i>; which, however
      fragrant in <i>small</i> quantities, is uniformly ungrateful when <i>copiously</i>
      supplied. <i>It is a boroughing creature</i>. *

      drink, clothing, furniture, live-stock, and every convenience of life;
      furnishing their residences with the plunder of our property. They have
      particular haunts, to which they entice each other in large numbers, for
      the sake of <i>prey</i>; where they often do incredible damage to our <i>mounds</i>,
      and undermine the strongest <i>embankments</i>. Sometimes they hoard their
      plunder in <i>nests</i>, that they make at a distance from their usual <i>places
      of congregating. * They are very bold and fierce. Instead of waiting for
      an attack, they usually become the aggressors, and, </i>seizing their
      adversaries by the lips<i>, inflict dangerous, and even deadly wounds.
      While they subsist on our industry, and increase our terrors, they make no
      grateful returns, and, therefore, mankind have studied various ways for
      diminishing their numbers; but their </i>cunning<i> discovers the most
      distant danger, and if any are disturbed or attacked, in an unusual
      manner, the rest take the alarm, and, becoming exceedingly shy, and wary,
      elude the most ingenious devices of their pursuers. When, unhappily, you

      This offensive insect lives in <i>stagnant</i> waters, continually

      are <i>hard and prominent</i>, the shoulders <i>broad and flat</i>. It
      wastes twenty times as much as its appetite requires; one can destroy
      thirty or forty of the libellula kind, each as large as itself. It is
      nevertheless greatly overrun with a small kind of lice, which probably
      repay the injuries it inflicts elsewhere. At certain seasons it flies to
      <i>distant waters</i> in search of food; but it remains where it was
      produced until fully grown, when it sallies forth in search of a companion
      of the other sex, and soon begets an useless generation.*

      THE BLOODHOUND.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Ladies and Gentlemen,
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the most terrible animal in the Collection. Its character is that
      of decided <i>enmity to man</i>; it hunts down those who endeavor to
      regain their <i>Liberty</i>, and is called the <i>Ban</i> Dog. When it
      scents a human victim it follows his track with cruel perseverance, flies
      upon him with dreadful ferocity, and, unless dragged off, tears and rends
      the form until every noble feature of humanity is destroyed. It has an
      exquisite smell for blood. The species vary little throughout the world :
      there is scarcely any difference between the trans-atlantic <i>Spanish</i>
      blood-hound and the <i>Irish</i> wolf-dog, whose ferocity has been much
      diminished by the animal being frequently <i>crossed</i>. It is still kept
      on some of the old <i>royal grounds</i>.

      THE BOOBY.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Ladies and Gentlemen,
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Creature</i> you now see is a sort of <i>Noddy</i> of the Gull
      kind. Observe his uncouth form and his ludicrously wise looks! He is the
      most stupid of the <i>feathered</i> tribe; yet he has a <i>voracious</i>
      appetite, and an enormous swallow. You perceive that he feigns the
      appearance of being <i>upright</i>, of seeming to comprehend objects he
      sees, of listening to what he hears, and that he shakes his head with <i>gravity</i>,
      as though he had a certain degree of understanding. His greatest pleasure
      is in <i>standing still.</i> He has not sense enough to <i>get out of
      People's way</i> ; speaking to him or making <i>motions</i> never disturb
      him. There is no compelling him to the fatigue of <i>changing</i> his
      position till he feels a <i>blow</i>; for he keeps his place till he is
      approached quite close, and <i>knocked down</i>. He is a living <i>full
      stop</i>. When he is <i>forced to walk</i>, which is very seldom, he goes
      from <i>side to side</i>. Like others of similar tribes, he boroughs. In
      this respect the union and affection of these <i>Creatures</i> towards
      each other is wonderful; for, when undisturbed by the encroachments of <i>men</i>,
      they construct their <i>nests</i> as convenient as if they expected them
      to be <i>permanent</i>; arranging their different places with such an
      amazing degree of uniformity, as to resemble a <i>regular plantation</i>.
      Sometimes they draw up side by side, in rank and file, and sit brooding
      together as if in deep counsel, on affairs of moment&mdash;their <i>silliness</i>
      and <i>solemnity</i> exciting involuntary <i>laughter!</i> This <i>burlesque</i>
      takes place, in particular, about
    </p>

      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link108" id="link108"></a><a
      href="../44520-page-images/p108.jpg">108</a></span>the month of <i>November</i>.
      The habits of these tribes are known through those who visit the haunts
      they have forsaken for more obscure <i>retreats</i>, where they can <i>build
      aloft</i>, and settle in their <i>nests</i> at ease: a practice which
      confirms the remark of a great naturalist, that the presence of <i>men</i>
      not only destroys the society of the <i>meaner</i> animals, but even
      extinguishes their <i>grovelling</i> instincts. Hitherto the Booby has
      been considered of no service whatever; yet a similar species, * by
      drawing a wick through the body and lighting it, is made into a <i>candle</i>S.
      ** If this Booby could be thus used, the <i>illumination of</i> both
      Houses and the public offices might be speedily effected, and the tribe he
      belongs to be rendered available to human purposes. At any rate a skilful
      tallow-chandler might try his hand at converting the <i>Creature</i> into
      A TWOPENNY FLAT

      THE BOA DESOLATOR, OR LEGITIMATE VAMPIRE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      It overlays the continent like an ugly Incubus, sucking the blood and
      stopping up the breath of man's life. It claims Mankind as its property,
      and allows human nature to exist only upon sufferance; it haunts the
      understanding like a frightful spectre, and oppresses the very air witha
      weight that is not to be borne. Hazlitt's Political Essays and Characters,
      p. 21.
    </p>
    <p>
      This hideous Beast, not having at any time put forth all his <i>members</i>,
      cannot be accurately described. Every <i>dark</i> Century has added to his
      frightful bulk. More disgusting than the filthiest reptile, his strength
      exceeds all other <i>brute force</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      His enormous, bloated, toad-like body is <i>ferruginous: * the under
      surface appears of </i>polished steel<i>. His cavern-like mouth is always
      open to devour; his teeth are as </i>swords<i>, and his jaw-teeth as
      knives'&mdash;as millions of </i>bristling bayonets<i> intermingled with
      </i>black fangs<i> containing mortal venom. His roar is a voice from the
      sepulchre. He is marked 'in form of a cross</i>, ** with a series of <i>chains</i>,
      intersected by the triangle, *** and glittering colours, variegated with
      <i>red</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      His aspect is cruel and terrible. He loves the <i>dark</i>, but never
      sleeps. Wherever he makes his lair, nature sickens, and man is brutified.
      His presence is 'plague, pestilence, and famine, battle, and murder, and
      sudden death.' His bite rapidly <i>undermines the strongest</i>
      Constitution, and dissolves the whole into an entire mass of Corruption.
      He has no <i>brain</i>, but the <i>walls</i> of the skull emit a <i>tinkling</i>
      sound, that attracts his victims, and lulls them into <i>passive obedience</i>.
      In this state he clutches them in his coils, and <i>screws and squeezes</i>
      them to destruction&mdash;<i>slavering</i> them over, and sucking in their
      <i>substance</i> at leisure. It is difficult to witness the half-stifled
      cries of his harmless prey, or to behold its anxiety and trepidation,
      while the monster writhes hideously around it, without imagining <i>what
      our own case would be in the same dreadful situation.</i> *****

      His rapacity is increased by <i>indulgence</i>. He grinds, cranches, and
      devours whole multitudes, without being satisfied. His blood is cold. His
      ravening maw does not digest: it is an ever-yawning grave that <i>engulphs</i>&mdash;a
      'bottomless pit' continually crying '<i>give, give!</i>' Sometimes he
      rests <span class="pagenum"><a name="link112" id="link112"></a><a
      href="../44520-page-images/p112.jpg">112</a></span>from his labors,' to
      admire his loathsome <i>limbs</i>, and <i>slime</i> them over. He has no
      affections: yet he appears charmed by the <i>hum</i> of the insects that
      follow him, and pleased by the <i>tickling crawl</i> of the meanest
      reptiles-permitting them to hang upon his lips, and partake of his
      leavings. But his real pleasure is in listening to the cries of his
      captives, the wail of the broken hearted, and the groans of the dying.

    <p>
      He lives in defiance and scorn of Providence, and in hatred to the
      happiness of man. When distended with human carnage, and wet with the gore
      of the innocent and the helpless, he lifts an impious <i>form</i> to
      heaven in solemn mockery. He was predicted of by the Seer of old, as the
      Beast with many heads and crowns, bearing the name of Blasphemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The garish <i>colours</i> that denote his malignity, excite only horror
      and detestation in the lover of nature, and of his species. They are most
      <i>lively</i> when he is engaged in the work of death, and cause him to be
      admired by the vulgar multitude, learned and unlearned, who hold him <i>sacred</i>,
      pay him <i>divine honors</i>, call him <i>holy</i>, and fall down before
      him as an object-of worship, while priests glorify him, and minister to
      him, and pray for his murderous successes in the temples. Hence-the good
      and the wise, in all ages, have devised and practised various methods for
      the destruction of a Fiend that creates nothing but <i>terror and
      imposture</i>, and between whom and rational man there is a natural
      antipathy.

      He is filled with the deadliest rage by the encreasing growth of the <i>pop'lar

      INTRODUCTION.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
    I lately dream'd that, in a huge balloon,
    All silk and gold, I journey'd to the Moon,
    Where the same objects seem'd to meet my eyes
    That I had lately left below the skies;

     And judge of my astonishment, on seeing
     All things exactly, to a hair, agreeing:
     The mountains, rivers, cities, trees, and towers,
     On Cynthia's silver surface, seem'd like ours;
     Men, women, children, language, dress, and faces,
     Lords, Commons, Lackies, Pensioners, and Places,
     Whigs, Tories, Lawyers, Priests, and men of blood,
     And even <i>Radicals</i>&mdash;by all that's good!

     In a long street, just such as London's Strand is,
     'Midst Belles and Beggars, Pickpockets and Dandies,
     Onward I went, between a brazen horse,
     And a large Inn which bore a Golden Cross,
     Then through a passage, narrow, long and dark,
     That brought my footsteps to a spacious park.

     It chanc'd that morning that the Sovereign Dey,
     The Prince of Lunataria pass'd that way&mdash;
     Gods! what a sight! what countless crouds were there,
     What yells, and groans, and hootings, rent the air!
     By which, I learn'd, the Lunatarian nation
     Are wont to testify their admiration;
     We don't do so on earth&mdash;but that's no matter&mdash;
     The Dey went onward, midst a hideous clatter
     To meet the Senators; for'twas appointed,
     That, on that morning, He&mdash;the Lord's anointed&mdash;
     Should make a grand Oration from the throne,
     That his most royal pleasure might be known.

     Respecting certain great affairs of State:&mdash;
     I heard the speech; Oh! could the muse relate
     The "<i>elegance</i> the sweet "<i>distinctiveness</i>"
     With which his Royal Deyship did address
     That reverend body of Moonarian sages,
     I'd write a book that should endure for ages.

     Alas! such heights are not for me to reach;
     I'll therefore, from my note-book, take the Speech,
     And you must say, as'tis by Pope exprest,
     "Give all thou canst, and <i>we</i> will dream the rest!"

      When a gang of desperate ruffians disguise themselves, and take the road

      PREFACE.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       "Perish those poets, and be hush'd the song,
        Which with this <i>nonsense</i> charm'd the world so long,
        That he who does no right, can do no wrong."

                                         De Foe.
</pre>
    <p>
      To condemn <i>nonsense</i>, especially in high places, is proper: there
      are ancient precedents for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thousand years before Christ, Nathan, a priest in the house of the Lord
      at Jerusalem, knew that David the Lord's anointed, had not only worked <i>folly</i>
      in Israel, by committing adultery with a beautiful woman, but had
      committed <i>crime</i>, by causing her husband to be put to death. The
      honest priest charged both the folly and the crime upon the king! He went
      up to his majesty with this Address: "<i>Thou art the man!</i>" He
      prosecuted him at the bar of his own conscience, convicted him, and passed
      sentence upon him&mdash;"<i>The sword shall not depart from thine house!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      Three thousand years after this, a priest, sent into an English House of
      Lords by the nomination of the king, affirms there, that "he had 'high
      authority' for stating, that the king could not commit <i>folly</i>. much
      less <i>crime!"</i> right? <span class="pagenum"><a name="link138"
      id="link138"></a><a href="../44520-page-images/p138.jpg">138</a></span>If
      he does say this, I ask him, how long, after oppression should be
      exercised through the prerogative by virtually irresponsible ministers and
      be declared no wrong, he supposes that a king of England could sit on the
      throne, or the bishops who maintain the doctrine, sit either at its right
      hand in the Lords, or any where else? I tell this bishop, that though the
      law may not suppose it possible for a king of England to do wrong, because
      it intends him to do right, yet if he <i>should</i> do, and <i>continue</i>
      to do, oppressive wrong, not all the bishops of England, nor all the
      bayonets of all the mercenaries of Europe, could keep that king upon the
      throne of an oppressed people against their united will.
    </p>
    <p>
      A king of England is not king in his own right, or by hereditary right.
      The nation is not a patrimony. He is not king by his own power; but in
      right of, and by the power of the law. He is not king above the law; but
      by, or under, the law. All the authority that he has, is given to him by
      law; and he can only rule <i>according</i> to law: for were he to rule <i>against</i>
      the law, he would be <i>king</i> against the law, and depose himself. The
      law is the Sovereign, or paramount authority; hence, a king of England is
      a subject; and in this respect, he and all the people are upon a level
      before the law&mdash;they are all his fellow-subjects ; though, as chief
      magistrate, he is the <i>first</i> subject of the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      A king of England who regards the happiness of the people, and his own
      safety, would not wish to be stronger <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link139" id="link139"></a><a href="../44520-page-images/p139.jpg">139</a></span>than
      the law founded on the public will, makes him. More strength would be
      unnecessary to <i>his</i> welfare, and hurtful to theirs. All power <i>over
      others</i>, from the watch-box to the throne, tends to injure the
      understanding, and corrupt the heart. A good King would not desire
      unlimited power; a bad one would abuse it. He would become mad; and drive
      the people mad. A despot is a demon. Artillery and fetters with the royal
      robe flung over them&mdash;a cannon ball capped with the royal crown&mdash;animated
      by the royal will&mdash;crushing, burning, and butchering liberty,
      property, and human life&mdash;personify the power of an unlimited King.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ensuing satire shows the folly and danger of such power. It is a
      partial revival of the <i>Jure Divino</i>, written by Daniel De Foe in
      1706. After the lapse of a century, nearly the same reason exists for the
      publication as the author adduced on its first appearance. It had never
      appeared, he says, "had not the world seemed to be going mad a second time
      with the error of passive obedience and non-resistance." It is not
      precisely so now: the <i>people</i> have not gone mad, but a <i>bishop</i>
      has, who may bite his brethren; and there is a slavish party of High
      Church zealots and pulpit casuists in the country who virtually support
      the doctrine&mdash;although if they attempt reducing it to practice, they
      may dig a pit beneath the throne, and engulph the dynasty. To expose this
      destructive doctrine, and disentangle the threads so artfully twisted into
      snares for the unwary by <span class="pagenum"><a name="link140"
      id="link140"></a><a href="../44520-page-images/p140.jpg">140</a></span>priestcraft,
      De Foe composed his Satire. He was the ablest politician of his day, an
      energetic writer, and, better than all, an honest man; but not much of a
      poet. The <i>Jure Divino</i> is defective in arrangement and
      versification. It is likewise disfigured by injudicious repetition; a
      large portion is devoted to the politics of the time, and it is otherwise
      unfit for republication entire ; but it abounds with energetic thoughts,
      forcible touches, and happy illustrations. The present is an attempt to
      separate the gold from the dross. The selection is carefully made; from
      the parts rejected the best passages are preserved, the rhyme and metre
      are somewhat bettered, the extracts are improved and transposed, and many
      additions of my own are introduced. The production scornfully rejects the
      slavish folly, senseless jargon, and venal hypocrisy, which pretend that
      power is from God and not from the People. It defies those who draw upon
      scripture in support of <i>Divine Right</i> to show that scripture lays
      down any rules of <i>political</i> government, or enjoins any <i>political</i>
      duties; or that it does not leave the people to determine by their own
      reason what government and what governors are best for themselves. It is a
      forcible and argumentative satire against the <i>nonsense</i> from
      hole-and-corner and lawn-sleeve men; and presents a series of peculiarly
      strong and quotable lines, to engraft on the common sense of the
      free-minded, honest, and open-hearted of my countrymen. If it aids them in
      the occasional illustration and emphatic expression of <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link141" id="link141"></a><a
      href="../44520-page-images/p141.jpg">141</a></span>their opinions, the
      pains I have taken will be rewarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is another reason for publishing this satire, besides the revival of
      Priestcraft. Its twinbrother is alive. Kingcraft rears up its terrific
      mass, muffled in the mantle of Legitimacy; its head cowled and crowned,
      aud dripping with the holy oil of Divine Right; its eyes glaring deadly
      hate to human happiness; its lips demanding worship for itself. Denouncing
      dreadful curses against the free, and yelling forth threatenings and
      slaughter, it stamps with its hoof, and coils together its frightful force
      to fall on young Liberty and squelch it. Its red right-arm is bared for
      the butchery of the brave who love Freedom and dare contend for it. It has
      prepared its chains and dug its dungeons, erected its scaffolds, aud
      sharpened its axes for the wise and excellent of the earth; and its bloody
      banners are unfurled in insolent anticipation of unholy triumph!&mdash;

      THE SPIRIT OF DESPOTISM.

    <p>
      The above Rare and Extraordinary Book was privately printed in 1795,
      without the name of either printer or bookseller, and so effectually
      suppressed, that there are only two copies of it besides my own in
      existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its real value consists in exhibiting an entire and luminous view of the
      causes and consequences of Despotic Power. Its enthusiastic and glowing
      love of Liberty is unexcelled by any work written since; and for
      clearness, richness, and beauty of style, it is superior to every
      production of the Press within the same period All that the author
      touches, he turns into gold. I regret to say that most probably I shall
      never be at liberty to disclose his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally desirous that such a work should be perused by all England, I
      have reprinted it, verbatim, from my own copy; and, although containing as
      much in quantity as a volume of Gibbon's History of Rome, it is sold for
      <i>Eighteen-pence</i>.

     The <i>French</i>, instantly perceiving the transcendent
     merit of the Spirit of Despotism, and its high importance at
     this crisis, have translated it into their language, and it
     is now read throughout France with the greatest avidity. I
     intreat some good <i>Neapolitan</i> to be the benefactor of his

          James the First held the highest notions concerning Divine
          Right. He had a mighty desire to be a great tyrant, but was
          merely a great driveller. He said on a certain occasion that
          "<i>there is an implicit tie among kings, which obligeth them,

          This obligation among kings <i>to right one another</i>, flows

     The first <i>Paternal</i> ruler of mankind
     That e'er by primogenial title reign'd,
     In dignity of government was high
     But all his kingdom was his family.

     His subjects&mdash;were his household and his wife;
     His power&mdash;to regulate their way of life;
     His sway&mdash;extended not beyond his gate;
     That was the limit&mdash;of his regal state;
     And every son might from his rule divide,
     Be King himself, and by himself preside;
     And when he died, the government went on
     In natural succession to his son.

     Next Families of mutual love and unity
     Together join'd for friendship and <i>community</i>;
     Form'd Laws, and <i>then</i> the natural order was
     To trust some man to execute the Laws.

     Hence him they best could trust, they trusted&mdash;chose;
     And thus a <i>Nation</i> and a chief arose,
     Both constituted by a mutual trust;
     The people honest and the ruler just. *

          * No hereditary king ever reigned in the world, but to
          govern by laws and constitutions which were established
          <i>before</i> he came to be king.&mdash;Coke's Detection, vol. i. p.
          13.

     'Tis plain, when man came from his Maker's hand,
     He left him free, and at his own command;
     Gave him the light of nature to direct,
     And reason, * nature's errors to inspect;
     No rules of Government were e'er set down,
     Nature was furnish'd to direct her own;
     The high unerring light of Providence,
     Left that to latent cause and consequence.

          * Reason is the image of God stamped upon man at his birth,
          the understanding breathed into him with the breath of life,
          and iu the participation of which alone he is raised above
          the brute creation, and his own physical nature!&mdash;Reason is
          the queen of the moral world, the soul of the universe, the
          lamp of human life, the pillar of society, the foundation of
          law, the bea-con of nations, the golden chain let down from
          heaven, which links all animated and all intelligent natures
          in one common system&mdash;and, in the vain strife between
          fanatic iuuovation and fauatic prejudice, we are exhorted to
          dethrone this queen of the world, to blot out this light of
          the mind, to deface this fair co-lumn, to break in pieces
          this golden chaiu!&mdash;Hazlitt's Political Essays, p. 57.

     Society to regulation tends,
     As naturally as means pursue their ends;
     The wit of man could never yet invent,
     A way of life without a government;
     And government has always been begun,
     In those who, to be govern'd, gave the crown.

     He that would other schemes of rule contrive
     And search for powers the people could not give,
     Must seek a spring which can those powers convey,
     And seek a People too that will obey.

     At length paternal rule was less complete,
     And as mankind increas'd became unfit;
     The petty Lords grow quarrelsome and proud,
     And plunge their little governments in blood.

     The factious rivals on pretence of <i>right,</i>
     Urge on the people to contend and fight;
     Invaded weakness to brute force submits,
     Oppression rages, honesty retreats,
     Justice gives way to power, and power prevails,
     And universal slavery entails.

     Thus broils arose, and thus the ends of life
     Are miss'd in Wars and undecided strife!
     Scotland, till late, exemplified the plan,
     In many a feud, in many a Highland clan.

     The Chief with whoop and whistling trumpet shrill,
     Summons his slaves from ev'ry neighb'ring hill;
     Tells them, his foeman's bull has stol'n his cow,
     And dire revenge th' obedient vassals vow;
     With mighty targe, and basket-hilted knife,
     Battle and blood decide the petty strife;
     The namelings fight, because the lord commands,
     And wild confusion rules th' ungovern'd lands!

     The <i>hunter-tribes</i>, at first, wild beasts pursued,
     And then to chase mankind they left the wood;
     Became Banditti, Captains, Chieftains, Kings,
     And Tyrants, by the natural course of things!

     As he that ravaged most could rule the best,
     So he grown King that first subdued the rest,
     By fraud and force his <i>guilty power</i> maintains,
     Wheedles mankind to please themselves with chains,
     With selfish Kingcraft calls it Right Divine,*
     And subtle Priestcraft sanctifies his <i>line</i>.

     "Kings are as Gods."&mdash;Indeed!&mdash;why then they must
     Like God be <i>sacred</i>,&mdash;but like God <i>be just</i>.

     If in a King a vicious lust prevails,
     The people see it, and the Godship fails. *

          * The time has been when rulers have actually claimed the
          title of <i>God's vicegerents,</i> and have been literally
          worshipped as gods by the servile crew of courtiers;&mdash;men
          gradually bowed down by despotism from the erect port of
          native dignity, and driven, by fear, to crouch under the
          most degrading of all superstition, the political idolatry
          of a base fellovv-creature.&mdash;After all the lan-guage of
          court adulation, the praises of poets and oiators, the
          statues and monuments erected to their fame, the malignant
          consequences of their actions prove them to have been no
          other than conspirators against the improvement and happi-
          ness of the human race. What were their means of conduct-ing
          their governments, of exercising this office of Heaven's
          vicegerents? Crafty, dishonest arts, oppression, extortion,
          and, above all,  fire and sword. They dared to ape the
          thunder and lightning of Heaven, and, assisted by the
          machinations of the grand adversary of man, rendered their
          imitative contrivances for destruction more terrible and
          deadly than the original. Their imperial robe derived its
          deep crimson colour from human blood; and the gold and
          diamonds of their diadems were accumulated treasures wrung
          from the famished bowels of the poor, born only to toil for
          others, to be robbed, to be wounded, to be trodden under
          foot, and forgotten in an early grave. How few, in com-
          parison, have reached the age of three score and ten, and
          yet, in the midst of youth and health, their days lifive
          been full of labour and sorrow. Heaven's vicegerents seldom
          bestowed a thought npon them, except when it was necessary
          either to inveigle or to force them to take the sword and
          march to slaughter. Where God caused the sun to shine gaily,
          and scattered plenty over the land, his vicegerents diffused
          famine and solitude. The valley, which laughed with corn,
          they watered with the tear of artificial hunger and distress
        ; the plain that was bright with verdure, and gay with
          flowerets, they dyed red with gore. They operated on the
          world as the blast of an east wind, as a pestilence, as a
          deluge, as a conflagration.&mdash;It is an incontrovertible
          axiom, that all who are born into tlie world, have a right
          to be as happy in it as the un-avoidable evils of nature,
          and their own disordered passions will allow. The gtand
          object of all good government, of all govern-ment that is
          not an usurpation, must be to promote this happi-ness, to
          assist every individual in its attainment and security. A
          government chiefly anxious about the emoluments of office,
          chiefly employed in augmenting its own power, and
          aggrandizing its obsequious instruments, while it neglects
          the comfort and safety of individuals in middle or low life,
          is despotic and a nui-sance. It is founded on folly as well
          as wickedness, and, like the freaks of insanity, deals
          mischief and misery around, without be-ing able to ascertain
          or limit its extent and duration. If it should not be
          punished as criminal, let it be cosrced as dangerous. &mdash;
          Spirit of Despotism, p. 90.

     The greatest curses any age have known
     Have issued from the temple, or the throne;
     Extent of ill from kings at first begins,
     But priests must aid, and consecrate their sins.

          The tortured subject might be heard complain,
          When sinking nnder a new weight of chain,
          Or more rebellious, might perhaps repine,
          When tax'd to dow'r a titled concubine,
          But the priest christens all a <i>Right Divine! </i>

     Is but&mdash;a thing at which we laugh&mdash;<i>a jest!</i>
     Let us to Scripture History appeal,
     And see what truths its ancient rolls reveal:&mdash;
     That great authority which Tyrants boast,
     As most confirming, will confound them most!
     When Israel with unheard of murmurs first,
     Pray'd to indulgent Heaven they might be curst,
     Rejected God, scorn'd his Almighty rule,
     And made themselves their children's ridicule,
     A standing banter, future ages' jest,
     As damn'd to slavery at their own request&mdash;
     With what just arguments did Samuel plead,
     Give them the Tyrant's character to read;
     Explain the lust of an ungovern'd man,
     Show them the danger, preach to them in vain;
     Tell them the wretched things they'd quickly find,
     Within the pleasing name of King combined;
     Deign with their'wilder'd crowds t' expostulate,
     And open all the dangers of their fate!&mdash;
     Yet they sought ruin with unwearied pains,
     And begg'd for fetters, slavery, and chains!

     But, it's replied, heaven heard its suppliant's prayer,
     Itself chose out the King, and plac'd him there;
     Disown'd the People's right, and fix'd their choice
     In providence, and not the people's voice;
     From whence the claim of right by regal line,
     Made Israel's Kings be Kings by Right Divine.

     Yes, Saul was King by God's immediate hand&mdash;

     Gave all that they pretended to require,
     But in the gift he punish'd the desire;
     He gave a plague, the very selfsame thing
     They ask'd, when they petition'd for a King!

     For 'tis remarkable when Samuel saw,
     They'd have a King in spite of sense or law,
     He told the consequences to the land,
     And all the mischiefs that the Word contain'd;
     Told them, that Kings were instruments design'd,
     Not to improve, but to correct mankind!

     Told them the Tyrant would insult their peace,
     And plunder them of all their happiness!

     Told them, that Kings were but exalted thieves,
     Would rob men first, and then would make them slaves!

     Then drew the picture of a monster crown'd,
     Ask'd them, if  such a villain could be found, *
     Whether they'd like him, and their tribute bring?
     They answer, Yes:&mdash;let such a man be King!

          * It is remarkable, that a king scarcely ever exercised
          tyran-nical power over the people, but it was mingled with
          ungoverned vice in himself. Men of virtue and moderation
          seldom, if ever, turn tyrants. Despotic rule gives the reins
          to lust, and makes the errors of government, and the crimes
          of life, mix together. It is the high road to cruelty and
          brutalizing selfishness.&mdash;A king of France took out his
          watch when he guessed that the axe was cutting off the head
          of his favoritè, and said; 'My dear friend must make a sad
          figure just now!'&mdash;A hill in Richmond Park is still shewn as
          remarkable for having been the station from whence Henry
          VIII. eagerly looked out for the ascent of a rocket at
          London, announcing to the impatient tyrant the precise
          moment when one of his wives was suffering death on the
          scaffold!

     And is a Tyrant King your early choice?
     "<i>Be Kings your plague!</i>"   said the Eternal's voice;
     And with this mighty curse he gave the crown,
     And Saul, to Israel's terror, mounts the throne!
     Now, Muse, the parallel with caution bring,
     On what condition was this man their King?

     Tho' Heaven declar'd him, heaven itself set down
     The sacred <i>Postulata</i> of the crown;
     Samuel examin'd first the high record,
     Then dedicates the substance to the Lord.

     This is the <i>coronation-oath</i>, the bond,
     The steps on which the throne and kingdom stand;
     For which, by future Kings unjustly broke,
     God, and the People, mighty vengeance took! *

          * Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and
          wrote it in a book and laid it up before the Lord. (1
          Samuel, x. 25.) It is plain, the word manner signifies the
          constitution of the government, or the conditiom on which
          Saul was to be king, namely, according to justice and law;
          and this is meant in frequent expressions, by going in and
          out before them, referring to justice being executed in the
          gates, and peace and war; the king was to lead them in one,
          and direct in the other. This manner of the kingdom was told
          to all the people, and that implied, that the consent of the
          people was requisite to make him king, without which, though
          Samuel had anointed him, he was not owned by the Israelites,
          bnt went about his private affairs till after the victory
          over the Ammonites. Then the manner of the kingdom was
          written in a book&mdash;a token of its being a compact between
          Saul and the people; and Samuel's laying it up before the
          Lord, is equivalent to an oath recorded on both sides; for
          it was there as a witness between the king and the people,
          and served both as their oath of allegiance, and his oath of
          government.&mdash;All this being done, what followed? All the
          people went to Gilgal, and there they (mark the word) made
          Saul king.&mdash;(l Samuel,i. 15.)

     Then mark the needful steps to make him King,
     How sacred ends, concurring means must bring;
     Not Samuel's ointment, not the mighty lot,
     Could make him King, nor force his title out.

     The people like not his mechanic race,
     They see no greatness in his youthful face:&mdash;
     "Is this the monarch shall our foes destroy,
     Does heaven design to rule us by a <i>boy</i>?"

     The flouting Rabbies cry! "We scorn to own,
     A man that has no merit for a crown.
     Our King must lead the glorious tribes to fight,
     And chase the thousands of the Ammonite:
     His pers'nal valour must our triumphs bring,
     'Tis such a man we want, and such a King."

     Away they go, reject his government,
     Not Heav'n's high choice could force their due consent!
     Samuel submits, adjourns the strong debate,
     Suspends the King he offered to create;
     Owns <i>their dislike's a high material thing,
     That their Consent alone could make him King!</i>

     Why did not God displeasure then express,
     Resent the slight, and punish their excess;
     Extort obedience by express command,
     And crown his choice by his immediate hand;
     Destroy the Rebels with his blasting breath,
     And punish early treason with their death;
     With mighty thunders his new King proclaim,
     And force the trembling tribes to do the same?

     Because He knew it was the course of things,
     And <i>Nature's law</i>, that men should <i>choose</i> their Kings;
     He knew the early dictate was his own,
     That reason acted from himself alone.*

          * It is alledged, that the vulgar are not capable of judging
          coucerning principles of government; I answer, they are
          then not capable of beiug guilty of transgression; for where
          there is a want of capacity of judgment, there can be no
          sin. This is a dangerous argument, my Lords, and exposes
          government to the violence of every one who can overturn it
          with impunity. You have no defence against any person in
          this case who is resolute, except superior strength; for
          the gallows will not frighten a man who is not conscious of
          guilt, if he has any degree of natural fortitude. Try to
          persuade the vulgar that there is any case in which they
          cannot sin, and you will soon perceive what opera-tion it
          will have upon them. But when you tell them they are not
          judges of your manouvres of state, they will soon tell you
          that they cannot transgress what they do not understand and
          that you require of them more than the Deity requires of
          them, or even supposes; for he requires no duty without
          first allowing men to judge of his laws, and makes no laws
          beyond the reach of their understandings.

     Why heaven permits the worst of men to rule,
     And binds the wise man to obey the fool; *

          * It is difficult to avoid laughing at the <i>extreme
          ignorance of crowned heads</i> themselves, in despotic
          countries, wheu one contrasts it with the importance they
          assume, and the pomp and splendour with which they transfer
          their royal persons from place to place. The sight is truly
          ludicrous. Are these the men, <i>occupied, as they usually
          are, in the meanest trifles and the most degrading
          pleasures,</i> who tell us that the governmen over which they
          preside, is a perfect system, and that the wisest
          philosopher knows not how to govern mankind; that is, to
          consult their happiness and security, so well as themselves,
          neglected as they have been in youth, and corrupted in
          manhood by panders to their vices, and flatterers of their
          foibles, their pride, and their ambition? There is reason
          to believe that <i>many kings in despotic kingdoms, have been
          worse educated, and possess less abilities, than a common
          charity-boy, trained in a parish school to read and write.</i>
          Spirit of Despotism. An Anecdote, containing the thoughts of
          a Despot is a treat. It appears from the Emperor of Austria
          heading the Holy Alliance against Naples with our money in
          his pockets, as well as from a letter dated Laybach, 28th
          January, 1821, that his Majesty has the <i>horrors.</i> The
          letter states, that when the Professors of the Lyceum at
          Laybach were presented to him, he made this nervous speech
        :&mdash;"Gentlemen&mdash;The students of Carniola have always deserved
          praise, (from which their progress in useful knowledge may
          be inferred). Endeavour to preserve for them this good
          character, (modern Boeotians). Remain ever faithful to what
          is ancient, (Tyranny); for what is ancient is good, (he
          means for himself); and onr ancestors (his Ancestors) ever
          found it so. Why should it not be the same to us? (The
          throne-men). People (tyrant-hater's) are occupied elsewhere
          (at Naples) with new notions (principles of liberty), that I
          (heigh Oh!) cannot approve, (cannot help); and never shall
          approve, (Royal till death). From such notions (political
          truth) preserve yourselves, (God preserve the Emperor);
          attach yourselves to nothing bnt what is positive,
          (Despotism). I do not want learned men (the students at
          Copenhagen on the king's birth-day, January 2nd, 1821,
          shouted "Vivat Rex the soldiers, not understanding Loyally
          in Latin, and, supposing the students uttered seditious
          cries, dispersed them with their sabres and hilled four:
          ergo Steel is stronger than Latin). I want only loyal and
          good subjects, (implicitly obedient slaves); and it is your
          part to (become drill serjeants, and) form them (into line).
          He who serves (implicitly obeys), will instruct, (that is&mdash;
          keep the students stupid) according to my orders; and
          whoever feels himself incapable of that, (non-instruction,)
          and embraces novel ideas, (knowledge,) had better depart&mdash;or
          I shall myself remove him, (by putting something into his
          head!). This is a fine and perfect specimen of legitimate
          mind; and here is another:&mdash;At the Museum of Bologna the
          Professors of the University shewed this same Emperor one or
          Sir Humphrey Davy's safety lamps, and informed him that the
          Englishman its inventor, had, by his nnmerous discoveries,
          produced a revolution in science. At the word revolution
          the countenance of the Emperor changed; he rumped the
          attendant, and said, the King of England would no doubt feel
          the consequences of his condescension to his unruly
          subjects; but, as to himself, he should take proper care
          not to suffer any of his subjects to make revo-lutions!&mdash;
          "<i>What is ancient is good.</i>" Stick to that, Despots! Yonr

     Kings spurn at limitations, laws, and rules,

     Wheedled to act against their common sense,

     To hope from God what God expects from them,
     For what they ought to do, look up to Him;
     Leave unperform'd the duties which they know,

     With approbation, often with success.

     Nor prayers nor tears will revolutions make,

          only way by which he has ever made an example of tyrants as
          a terror to others.

     Tyrants sometimes in Revolutions fall,
     Though their destruction's not design'd at all;
     So hasty showers, when they from heav'n flow down,
     Are sent to fructify, and not to drown;
     And, in the torrent, if a drunkard sink,

     It's doubtful who live most unnatural lives,
     The subject that his liberty survives,
     Or kings that trample law and freedom down,
     And make free justice truckle to the crown.

     Law is the master-spring of government&mdash;
     The only Right Ditine that heaven has sent, *
     It forms the order of the world below,
     And all our blessings from that order flow.

          * The tyrant Henry VIII., by making himself the head of the
          Church, clearly begat the Right Divine. The King could give
          bishoprics, and the Bishops could give opinions. "Your
          Majesty is the breath of our nostrils," said Bishop Neil to
          James I., and speaking of himself and brethren as to worldly
          advantages, he certainly spoke the truth. Before the Kings
          of England were heads of the Church we heard little of
          divine right, and some-times the Church itself was seen on
          the side of freedom; since that time, never. The doctrine
          in England, that the King can do no wrong, supposes the
          positive responsibility of his Minis-ters. But, that it is a
          dangerous licence of language, is wit-nessed iu a Right
          Reverend exposition of this kingly privi-lege in regard to
          Adultery. The Bishop leaped from political to moral
          delinquency, with a casuistry worthy an admirer of the royal
          power of translation. The Abbe de Choisy, a Priest of the
          same school as the British Father in God, though not of the
          same church, dedicated an edition of Thomas à Kempis, on the
          'Imitation of Christ' to Madame de Maintenon, a courtesan
          and mistress to Louis XIV., prefixing this motto: "Hear oh!
          daugh-ter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also
          thine own people, and thy father's honse; <i>so shall the
          King greatly desire thy beauty!</i>" Psa. xlv. 10,11.

          The Court's a golden but a fatal circle,
          Upon whose magic skirts a thousand devils
          In crystal forms, sit tempting innocence,
          And beckon early virtue from its ceutre.

     Law is the life-blood of the social state;
     Subordinate to law is magistrate,
     To set the magistrate above the law,
     Would all to error and confusion draw,
     He's not a king that's not prescribed by laws&mdash;
     King's, the effect, but government's the cause
     Of all authority for Right Divine,
     Custom's the worst, for every royal line.

     The still-born Ignorance of antiquity,
     Quirk'd into life to cozen freemen by,
     Lawyers call Custom; and, for custom, draw
     On custom still, to still call custom, <i>Law!</i>

     So  'rules' the <i>Bench</i>, and so the maxim takes,
     The fault one age commits, no age forsakes!

     Begot by fools, maintain'd by knaves and fools,
     Improved by craft in error's public schools;
     With shifting face, with loose and stammering tongue,
     The juggling fraud has plagued the world too long;
     Modern encroachments on our freedom makes,
     And backs it with our fathers' old mistakes:
     As if our rev'rence, to their virtues due,
     Should recommend their crimes and follies too!

     This vapour Custom, this mere wand'ring cloud
     Puffs the crown'd wretch, and helps to make him proud.
     Persuades him to believe it must be true,
     Homage to Law, becomes the <i>Tyrant's</i> due!

     Thus Priestcraft preaches, and thus Lawyers draw
     An after age, to call a custom&mdash;Law!

     And yet this boasted, ever-quoted thing,
     Fails in the point&mdash;fails to support the king:
     For though by custom, kings have learn'd to ride
     A few vile minions, to support their pride,
     The people always have opposed the cheat,
     It never was their custom to submit;
     The Practice of the people made the name,
     For practices and customs are the same;
     And custom this one mighty truth will tell,
     When kings grow tyrants, nations will rebel.

     The people may, for custom gives assent,
     Dethrone the man, to save the Government!
     If any say the practice is not so,
     Let them to England for examples go.

     England the Right Divine of kings profess'd *
     And all the marks of slavery caress'd;
     Long courted chains, but'twas in court disguise,
     And holy fraud conceal'd the sacred lies&mdash;

          * Sir Robert Filmer, the great champion of Divine Right
          having defended it in print, Algernon Sidney drew out a
          system of original power, and government according to the
          laws of God, nature, and reason. Before it was finished, the
          friends of Divine Right seized the manuscript, and finding
          Sidney's arguments un-answerable, they laid aside the work,
          and fell upon the man; &mdash;so they cut off his head, merely
          because they could not an-swer his book.

     The Church the mountebank, the King the jest,
     The <i>wheedled monarch</i>, and the <i>wheedling priest!</i>
     James proved the patient, crouching, loyal tribe,
     But let his fate their loyalty describe!

     With life-and-fortune, churchmen back'd the crown, *
     In crushing all men's freedom but their own.

          * A Courtier's loyalty is charmingly pictured in the
          portrait of Bubb Doddington, drawn by himself in his
          celebrated Diary. He was by trade a Boroughmonger, and his
          stock, consisted of six Members in the House of Commons,
          which he jobbed about and sold to the best bidder. At the
          close of his bargain and sale of the whole in a lump to the
          Duke of Newcastle for the king's service, there is a finish
          which renders the painting a fiue and matchless Cabinet
          specimen.&mdash;Bubb, who had been in disgrace at court for
          selling them elsewhere, said to tlie duke, "I knew I had
          given no just cause of offence, but that I could not justify
          it with His Majesty; that it was enough that He (the king)
          was displeased, to make me think that I was in the wrong,
          and to beg Him to forget it: I would not even be in the
          right against HIM!" The duke was delighted with this loyal
          and dutiful submission. Bubb says, "He took me up in his
          arms, and kissed me twice!" and Bubb was rewarded for
          laying his six members of the honorable house at the foot of
          the throne with the price he stipulated for&mdash;namely, the
          treasurership of the navy, and a peerage! The story was
          beautifully and most impressively related by the excellent-
          hearted and inflexible John Hunt, in his noble and
          successful defence, on the trial of an ex officio
          information for words in the Examiner charged not as false,
          but as libellous on the Honorable House.

     Then, under colour or pretence of law,
     Villains their victims to the shambles draw,
     Where sat the scoundrel Chief in ermined pride,
     And a pack'd jury in the box beside.

     The farce commences&mdash;justice heaves a groan&mdash;
     The case is clear&mdash;a verdict for the Crown!

     When noble Russell and brave Sidney fell,
     Judges themselves rung, out Law's funeral knell!

     Yet when their own destruction they foresaw,
     The passive knaves cried Liberty and Law!

     Took from their best of Kings his Right Divine,
     And abrogated fealty to the line;
     They made a precedent, dropp'd T from TReason,
     And found the best of words behind it&mdash;reason!

     The crown's a symbol, that the people meant,
     To mark their choice, or form of government; *
     The crown is theirs, and this has been their plan,
     To make the office sacred, not the man:
     Hence, if a tyrant on the throne appears,
     The place is vacant, and the crown is theirs.

          * All Majesty is derived from Law founded on right reason. A
          strength beyond that is mere force. The Magistrate formerly
          had no Majesty but while engaged in magisterial duties. His
          real dignity consisting in his legal authority.

          When the ancient parliaments of France met according to the
          constitution annually, the king went to meet the members
          seated in a waggon drawn by oxen, which a waggoner drove
          with his goad to the parliament house; but he was in no
          state until he was seated there, robed and crowned, and
          sceptred. And, in-deed, in that place only, where the great
          affairs of the Com-monwealth are transacted, can it be said,
          that Real Majesty does truly and properly reside; and not
          where the king plays, or dances, or prattles with his women,
          when the vulgar are always styling him, your Majesty.

     But you my people vilely have opprest,
     And misapplied the powers which you possest.
     'Tis Nature's laws the people now direct,
     When Nature speaks, I never contradict.

     Draw not the sword, thy brethren to destroy,
     The liberty they have, they may enjoy;
     I ever purposed, and I yet intend,
     That what they may enjoy, they may defend;
     They have deserted from a misused throne,
     "The thing's from Me"&mdash;the crime is all thy own!"*

          * When the ten tribes revolted from Rehoboam, and chose Je-
          roboam king, there is no doubt they limited him by law; for
          many years afterwards king Aliab, one of his succcssors,
          admring a herb-garden near to his own palace, applied to the
          owner, Naboth, and offered him either a vineyard for it, or
          the worth of it in money; but Naboth would neither exchange
          nor sell it, and Ahab returned home so vexed, that he went
          to bed and would not eat any thing. Naboth having thus
          displeased the king, the courtiers got up a charge of
          Blasphemy and Sedition against him by means of false
          wituesses hired on purpose; he was found guilty and
          executed, and Ahab got possession of the garden, probably as
          a forfeiture to the crown. It is clear, therefore, that
          Ahab's power was restrained by law, for it was not until
          Nabot was murdered <i>under the forms of law</i>, that the king
          could get the poor man's property. Another thing is very
          remarkable: as soon as the murder was completed, and the
          king had got the garden, there was an honest Father in God,
          who, instead of saying 'the king could do no wrong,' went to
          his majesty, charged him with the crime, and denounced his
          downfall, which happened accordingly, through his listening
          to flattering ecclesiastics, and his fondness for military
          affairs. If the Bishop of London should desire to preach on
          this story, he is informed that he may find it in the Bible,
          1 Kings, xxi.

     If kings no more be flatter'd and deceived,
     Nor shun too late, the knaves they have believed;
     If as 'trustees for uses' they agree
     To act by limited authority;
     Subordination will its order keep,
     Ambition die, and all rebellion sleep.

     The weeping nations shall begin to laugh,
     The subjects easy, and the rulers safe.

     Plenty and peace embrace just government,
     The king be pleased, the people be content.

     If any king is hoodwink'd to believe,
     People will blind obedience to him give;
     Let him pause long, before he dares to try,
     They all by practice give their words the lie! *

          * Flattery is a fine picklock of tender ears; especially of
          those whom fortune hath borne high upon their wings, that
          submit their dignity and authority to it, by a soothing of
          themselves. For, indeed, men could never he taken in that
          abundance with the springes of others' flattery, if they
          began not there; if they did but remember how much more
          profitable the bitterness of truth were than all the honey
          distilling from a whorish voice, which is not praise but
          poison. But now it is come to that extreme of folly, or
          rather madness, with some, that he that flatters them mo-
          destly, or sparingly, is thought to malign them.

          Ben Jonson.

          The ears of kings are so tiugled with a continual uniform
          ap-probation, that they have scarce any knowledge of true
          praise. Have they to do with the greatest fool of all their
          subjects&mdash;they have no way to take advantage of him: by the
          flatterer saying, "It is because he is my king," he thinks
          he has said enough to imply that he therefore suffered
          himself to be over-come. This quality stifles and confuses
          the other true and es-sential qualities which are sunk deep
          in the kingship.

     Art may by mighty dams keep out the tide,

     He that, invested with the robes of power,

     Each nation that deserves the name of state,
     Has set up laws above the magistrate;
     Hence, when a self-advancing wretch acquires
     A lawless rule, his government expires.

          * Childeric I. the son of Merovius, for his lasciviousness,
          was banished by the great men, and one Egidiu?, a Gaul, set
          up in his stead. Childeiic II. was banished and deposed by
          his subjects, and king Pepin reigned in his stead; and so
          ended the Merovingian family.

          ** The League deposed Henry III. and declared him a tyrant,
          a murderer, and incapable to reign, and held frequent
          counsels with the pope's legate and the Spaniards about
          settling the crown, and several proposals were made of
          settling it, sometimes on the infanta of Spain, at other
          times on the cardinal of Boubon, the duke de Main, and
          others.

          ***  Favila, a cruel tyrant, was deposed by the Castilians,
          who chose judges to administer the government, till they
          appointed another.

          **** Besides the banishment of Demetrius, the History of
          Russia furnishes a sickening catalogue of the butchery of
          her despots by each other. During the debate in the House of
          Lords on the 19th of February, 1821, Lord Holland, observing
          on the Crusade of the Holy Alliance of Despots against
          Naples, said, "That objections to the freedom of political
          constitutions came but ungracefully from the reigning
          Emperor of Russia, who ascended a throne reeking with the
          blood of his own father: and as this member of that holy
          league, owed his crown to the murder of his father, it
          brought to his recollection, that since the time of the Czar
          Peter I. no sovereign had ascended the throne of Russia
          with-out its being stained with the blood of his immediate
          predecessor, or some other member of his own family."

     Was left exposed to ev'ry robber's claim,
     An open prey to pirates, and the isle,
     To wild invaders, grew an early spoil.

     The Romans ravaged long our wealthy coast,
     And long our plains fed Caesar's num'rous host.

     What birthright raised that rav'nous leader's name?
     His sword, and not his fam'ly, form'd his claim.

     Where'er the Roman eagles spread their wings,
     They conquer'd nations, and they pull'd down kings;
     Caesar in triumph o'er the whole presided,
     And right of conquest half the world divided.

     For Liberty our sires in arms appear'd,
     And in its sacred name with courage warr'd;
     Made the invaders buy their conquest dear,
     And legions of their bones lie buried here. *

          * The hillocks or barrows still remaining in most parts of

     Shoals of Barbarian Goths, worse thieves than they,
     From Caledonian Friths, and frozen Tay,
     O'erspread the fruitful, now abandon'd plains,

      His right's as bad as Stephen's that bestows:
      The royal tricksters thus divide the prey,
      And helpless crowds the jugglers' swords obey. ***

      Then John, ****  another branch of Henry's line,
      Jumps on the throne, in spite of Right Divine,
      Turn we to mighty Edward's deathless name;
      Or to his son's, whose conquests were the same;
      That mighty hero of right royal race,
      His father still alive, usurp'd his place. (v)

          * They were both usurpers, for the true right of descent was
          in Edgar Atheling. of the race of Edmund Ironside.

          ** Henry II. was obliged to compromise the dispute with his
          competitor Stephen; a prudent agreement, but in defiance of
          hereditary right.

          *** As at the death of Henry I. the main line of Normandy
          ended, so the succession has ever since proved so brittle,
          that it never held to the third heir in a right descent
          without being put by, or receiving some alteration by
          usurpation, or extinction of the male blood.&mdash;Churchill's
          Divi Britannici, p. 207.

          **** King John was the youngest son of Henry II., who had
          his eldest line deposed. Henry was the son of a usurper, a
          usurper himself, and the murderer of his own brother's son.

          (v) Edward III. reigned, his father, Edward II. being a
          prisoner, and was afterwards murdered.

          *** Henry VI.

          **** Richard III. was succeeded by Henry VII. who had
          clearly no claim to the crown from blood. After him it still
          devolved with irregularity, although uuder the Tudors, the
          doctrine of hereditary right was as vaguely maintained as
          before. Thus, a Parliament granted to Henry VIII. the power
          of regulating the succession by will, and it was by
          pretending to exercise a similar power under an alleged will
          of Edward VI. that the unprincipled Northumberland sought
          the establishment of Lady Jane Grey. Elizabeth, on the same
          ground, was importuned to appoint a suc-cessor, at
          intervals, during the last twenty years of her reign; and
          finally, named the King of Scotland in her last moments.
          These are strange incidents for the advocates of Divine
          Right! The fact is, this wretched theory was never formally
          advocated until the days of James I.; and it may be
          considered to be one of the precions fruits of that settled
          connexion between Church and State, of which the Despot,
          Henry VIII., laid the foun-dation. Yet no Despot ever
          supported himself steadily on an English throne; and what is
          there to prove, that such men ever can? Look at King
          Richard II., he was a finished gentle-man, possessed some
          taste for literature, and shewed himself as. fond of finery
          as need be; but he waged war with the common sense of the
          realm and the rights of the people,&mdash;and finally, by
          entrusting his power to weak, inefficient, and corrupt
          ministers, roused the anger of a distressed and overtaxed
          community. Moral&mdash;They were beheaded, and he was dethroned.

          the Second's reign, in which Lord William Russel and
          Algernon Sydney were murdered under the forms of law, by
          packed juries, and the king's passive obedient judges&mdash;when
          the throne floated in blood, and the king's manners were
          notoriously and disgust-ingly sensual and dissolute&mdash;in that
          year, J. Shnrley, M. A. in his 'Ecclesiastical History
          Epitomised,' gives Charles the title of "the best of kings!"
          calls his life and reign virtuous! and prays that his days
          may be as the days of Heaven!&mdash;This loyal author calls
          himself, The Christian reader's "beloved Brother in Christ!"
          Of the same king, Charles II., Horace Walpole (Lord Orford)
          gives this character in his Epistle from Florence:&mdash;
          (Dodsley's Collection, vol. iii. p. 92.)

     Fortune, or fair, or frowning, on his soul
     Could stamp no virtue, and no vice controul!

     Honour or morals, gratitude or truth,
     Nor taught his ripen'd age, nor knew his youth!

     The care of nations left to whores or chance,
     Plund'rer of Britain, pensioner of France;
     Free to buffoons, to ministers denied,
     He lived an atheist, and a bigot died!

     <i>Right of Succession</i>, or what other claim
     Of right to rule, by whatsoever name
     Or title call'd, by whomsoever urged,
     Is in the people's right of choosing merged.

     The right's the People's, and the People's choice
     Binds kings in duty to obey their voice;
     The Public Will, the only Right Divine,
     Sanctions the office, or divides the line;
     Topples the crown from off the tyrant's head,
     And puts a king to govern in his stead.

     Tyrant and king are vastly different things&mdash;
     We're robb'd by tyrants, but obey'd by kings!

          * Tyrants lose all respect for humanity, in proportion as
          they are sunk beneath it; taught to believe themselves of
          a different species, they really become so; lose their
          participation with their kind; and, in mimicking the God,

          foreign despots claim mankind as their property. They regard
          men crawling on the face of the earth as we do insects that
          cross our path, and survey the common drama of human life as
          a fantoccini exhibition got up for tlieir amusement. It is
          the over-weening, aggravated, intolerable sense of swelling
          pride and ungovernable self-will that so often drives them
          mad; as it is their blind fatuity and insensibility to all
          beyond themselves, that, transmitted through successive
          generations, and confirmed by regal intermarriages, in time
          makes them idiots.

     Just laws and liberty make patriot kings;
     Tyrants and tyranny are self-made things. *

          * Though a Despot be transformed into a limited king, he is
          in heart and purpose still a despot. He feels duress; he is
          not at liberty to oppress at his pleasare; and he awaits an
          opportnnity to exercise 'the Right Divine of Kings to govern
          wrong;' for he holds the doctrine that "oaths are not to be
          kept with subjects." In the reign of Richard II. the Duke of
          Norfolk apprised the Duke of Hereford, that the King
          purposed their destruction:&mdash;

          Hereford.&mdash;God forbid!&mdash;He has sworn by St. Edward, to be a
          good Lord to me and the others.

          Norfolk.&mdash; So has he often sworn to me by God's Body: but I
          do not trust him the more for that!

          Every restored despot has become an unblushing and shameless
          perjurer; where is there in history an instance to the con-
          trary?&mdash;Once  a Despot, and always a Despot.

          Alfred the Great is the only King in our annals who being
          guilty of misgovernment, and seeing its evils had the high
          courage to acknowledge his crime by amendment. At the
          commencement of his reign he seemed to consider his exalted
          dignity as an emancipation from restraint, and to have found
          leisure, even amidst his struggles with the Danes, to
          indulge the irapetuosity of his passions. His immorality and
          despotism provoked the censure of the virtuous; he was
          haughty to his subjects, neglected the administration of
          justice, and treated with contempt the complaints of the
          indigent and oppressed. In the eighth year of his reign he
          was driven from the throne by the Danes. Narrowly escaping
          death and enduring many hardships, adversity brought
          reflection. According to the piety of the age, instead of
          tracing events to their political sources, he referred them
          immediately to the providence of God; and considered his
          misfortunes as the instrument with which Divine Justice
          punished his past enormities. By his prudence and valour he
          regaiued the throne, and drew np a code of laws by which he
          ordained the governmeat should be administered. Magistrates
          trembled at his stern impartiality and inflexibility. He
          executed forty-four judges in one year for their informal
          and iniquitous proceedings. Hence their survivors and
          successors were careful to acquire a competent degree of
          knowledge, and their decisions became accordant to the law.
          Discovering that the only real foundation of national
          happiness is in the enlightenment of the people, he
          instructed them himself by his writings, endowed
          establishments for the promotion of Education, and became
          the guardian and benefactor of his country.*&mdash;His virtues
          were the fruit of early instruction. When he was a child,
          his mother, Osburga, awakened in him a passion for learning
          aud knowledge. Holding in her hand a Saxon poem, elegantly
          written and beautifully illnminated, she offered it as a
          reward to the first of her children whose proficiency should
          enable him to read it to her. The emulation of Alfred was
          excited: he ran to his master, applied to the task with
          diligence, performed it to the satisfaction of the queen,
          and received the prize of his industry. His mind thus opened
          by this excellent woman, she dropped in the seeds of
          knowledge; by careful culture they grew into wisdom, and
          Alfred is one of the most illustrious instances of the
          endless blessings conferred upon man by Education.

          From the banks of the strong hold of Corfe Castle, in
          Dorsetshire, near Wareham, formerly a station of the Danish
          barbariaus, one of their successors making good his lodgment
          in a nameless House denies the justice of Universal
          Education, forgetful, perhaps, that the benighted savages,
          his predecessors, were finally expelled by Alfred; that it
          was the triumph of Knowledge and Liberty over Ignorance and
          Selfish power; and that Alfred, disdaining to use the
          advantage whick Education gave him over the rest of the
          people, othirwise than for their welfare, incessuntly
          laboured to dispense its benefits to All.

          out lands, and erect churches and palaces for the priests

          with holy oil, hedge them round with inviolability, spread
          over them the mysterious sanctity of religion, and, with
          very little ceremony, make over the whole species as slaves
          to these Gods upon earth by virtue of Divine Right!

      numerous applications for an edition in this size. He finds it as

      A Bag of political nuts ready cracked, is not only rather dangerous fare
      to serve up, but a man who takes the trouble to crack them, will find the
      kernels cleaner and sweeter for his pains. Though they who run may read
      the greater portion of the present sheet, yet there are a few articles
      that require attention, and two or three arc designed for those only who
      alone can understand them.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first intention was to parody Slop's paper, 'The Slop-tail,' or 'Much
      Times,' throughout. But he is as vapid as the Marquess of Lunnunderry. *
      What could I do with thoughts as unquotable, as confused, as ill
      conceived, as ill expressed, as that <i>puissante</i> ** Lord's &mdash;without
      depth or originality&mdash;as plentiful and superficial as duck-weed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found not a sparkle of talent in any of Slop's lean 'leaders' to re-pay
      me the trouble of wearisome reading. Under the 'stringent necessity' of
      varying my original plan, yet loth to abandon it altogether, I have
      parodied some of the features common to the Slop-pail, and supplied the
      department I had allotted to an imitation of his mindless verbiage with a
      sketch of his Life&mdash;filling the remainder of the sheet in my own way.
      There are discrepancies inseparable from this course, but I write to
      good-humoured readers, who have no objection to see the mind as well as
      the person of a friend in undress, and who take as little interest in the
      decision of the High Court of Criticism on things of this sort, as they
      took in the decision of the 'Court of Claims' concerning the 'imposing'
      ceremony of the coronation, and things of that sort.,

      gang destroying a Free Press, and suspending Liberty, while Slop is
      working his Press to distort and torture Truth.

      THE LIFE OF DOCTOR SLOP,
    </p>
    <h3>
      AND THE ORIGIN OF THE BRIDGE-STREET GANG.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The origin and the end of this man are alike uncertain. He was sent to
      Oxford when young, as a student destined for holy orders, under the
      patronage of the Bishop of Durham.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Go thou and seek the house of prayer:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
         I to the woodlands bend my way,

          And meet Religion there;

          She needs not haunt the high-arch'd dome to pray,

      These lines, in Mr. Southey's lyric poem, '<i>written on Sunday Morning</i>,'
      * express the thoughts of Slop when a college youth.

      href="../44520-page-images/p196.jpg">196</a></span>that time he had a sort
      of conscience; for, in consequence of an honest course of reading, he
      refused to subscribe to the Thirty-nine Articles. Thus disqualifying
      himself from being a candidate for the 'imposition of hands' by the
      Bishop, he for ever relinquished the prospect of entrance into the church,
      and cultivated his mind by reading Paine's <i>Rights of Man.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Fascinated by the writings of Mrs. Mary Wollstoncrofft, more especially by
      her celebrated '<i>Vindication of the Rights of Woman,</i>' he assiduously
      sought that lady's acquaintance, and having obtained the desired honour,
      cultivated her intimacy with passionate admiration. On the appearance of
      Mr. Godwin's '<i>Inquiry concerning Moral and Political Justice</i>,' he
      read and studied it with doting enthusiasm; the chapters on <i>Property</i>,
      and on <i>the Sexual Intercourse</i>, were particularly to his taste&mdash;the
      chapter on <i>Sincerity</i>, not so much. Hungering for a personal
      friendship with the author of the <i>Political Justice</i>, who became the
      husband of Mrs. Wollstoncrofft, he humbled himself before him, beseeching
      permission to consider that philosopher as his Gamaliel, and to sit at his
      feet as the least of his disciples. This was granted, and in that school
      he commenced an intimacy with Mr. Thomas Holcroft and his friends. That
      gentleman had just been released from imprisonment, under indictments for
      high treason, with Messrs. Hardy, Horne Tooke, and Thelwall, who were
      tried and acquitted of the charge; and at this time Slop's political
      fervor rose above the temperament of the most hot-blooded among the
      patriots he associated with. It had been fashionable to wear the hair long
      and. tied; he thought this aristocratic, cut his hair off to look like a
      democrat, became a <i>round-head</i>, and was called <i>Citizen S</i>. At
      length he was marked out from his fellows by the distinguishing
      appellation of '<i>the Jacobin</i>,' and he became a <i>Leveller</i>.
      Affixing to the words 'Liberty and Equality,' an interpretation of his
      own, he contended with the <i>Spenceans</i>, that there could be no real
      Liberty without Equality so he preached the doctrine of <i>all things in
      common</i>; and prevailed on a young man who had imbibed some of his
      notions, to aid him in proving its advantages. In an attic chamber in the
      Temple they founded a <i>community of goods</i>&mdash;lived on short
      commons &mdash;and waited on each other. Here Slop lighted the fire, and
      fetched water from the Temple pump for their joint use, till, tired of the
      pitcher-duty, he proposed <span class="pagenum"><a name="link197"
      id="link197"></a><a href="../44520-page-images/p197.jpg">197</a></span>transferring
      the undignified office to his companion, who declined to accept it; and a
      fierce quarrel arising in this 'perfect state of society,' concerning
      rights and duties, the Commonwealth of two ceased to exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this exigency, moderation, which at one time he seems to have thought
      criminal, became expedient on many accounts. About 1796 he visited
      Scotland, with letters of recommendation to respectable society; yet his
      wild opinions on religion and politics caused him to be disliked by some
      of the most respectable students who held Whig principles, and who, still
      holding them, dislike and shun him now for his extreme violence in another
      direction. When at Edinburgh, he affected singularity of habit as well as
      thought, and paraded the streets, especially the Leith-Walk, in a drab
      dress of romantic simplicity. On his return from Scotland, he employed
      himself in writing for the booksellers. In 1798 he translated the play of
      Don Carlos, from the German of Schiller, and presented his friend, Mr.
      Holcroft, with a copy, who says, that 'he executed his task respectably.'
      * On the 5th of August, in that year, he dined with Mr. Godwin and Mr.
      Parry (the Republican Editor of the Courier Newspaper when it was
      conducted on democratic principles), at the house of Mr. Holcroft, where,
      according to that gentleman's diary, ** he was, 'as usual, acute; but
      pertinacious and verbose. On the 25th of November, he wrote to Mr.
      Holcroft, complaining of neglect, *** who answered by denying such
      intention; and indeed his intimacy with the <i>coterie</i> at Mr.
      Holcroft's, was of the closest nature, and his attachment to that
      philosopher's principles and person so strong, that he proposed
      intermarriage with his family, which was declined. He remained ardently
      devoted to the new philosophy, long after Mr. Holcroft's death, and until
      Mr. Godwin found it convenient to decline his wearisome acquaintance.
      Fickleness and obstinacy, and the exercise of a faculty for incessant
      disputation, rendered his society very tedious to the philosophers.
      Fruitless attempts to repress or soften his pugnacious turn, exhausted
      their patience. In defence of themselves, they disregarded and finally cut
      him;&mdash;so <span class="pagenum"><a name="link198" id="link198"></a><a
      href="../44520-page-images/p198.jpg">198</a></span>that it became the <i>New
      Times</i> with him in philosophy.

      He rambled to conceal his discontent, and to get fresh notions and fresh
      friends. A pedestrian tour through Scotland, with letters of
      recommendation, and a pliability of manner accommodated to his new views,
      effected both. He published his <i>Tour</i> in 1801. It is written with
      extreme caution. His real opinions are kept out of the book as much as
      possible; yet they occasionally peep forth; for instance, he says, 'We
      seem inspired with enthusiasm to fall down and worship the golden image of
      commerce; let us not wholly submit our feelings to our purses, and
      counters, and ledgers&mdash;we may be very rich in products, and
      manufactures, and population, and very poor in the spirits and minds of
      men!' *&mdash;he dare not put that in his Slop-pail. In the <i>Tour</i>,
      he speaks in praise of the Rev. Sir Henry Moscreiff
    </p>
    <p>
      Wellwood, a Scottish Baronet of Whig principles, whose daughter he
      afterwards married, whether from <i>innate love of legitimacy</i>, or
      what, is unknown. Before he wrote the <i>Tour</i>, he procured the degree
      of LL.D. (as the Laureate has done since), and the philosopher, who had
      refused subscription to the Thirty-nine Articles to the Church of England,
      and had been in turn a Republican, a Jacobin, a Leveller, and a Spencean,
      became a Doctor of Laws, and sunk into the wig and gown of an advocate in
      the Ecclesiastical Court! Resuming an intimacy with some young men of his
      own stamp, who knew him at college, they obtained a place for him&mdash;he
      was made king's advocate at Malta. So fell Slop. Here ended his career of
      what he called Patriotism. He mistook passionate heat for the enthusiasm
      of genius, a habit of loud talking for talent, a ranting way of writing
      for reasoning, and pertinacity of manner for firmness of character. His
      vain disputations occasioned him to be noticed, and this he thought equal
      to being admired. Conceit of ability rendered him covetous of distinction;
      he acquired it&mdash;

               And beckon early virtue from its centre.'&mdash;

      courtiers, the tinsel and glitter of embroidered coats and waistcoats, the
      hum and sops- of office, hurried him into the train of ministerial
      menials, as easily as a beggar's hungry brat is seduced by the finery of
      gilt paper, and the sound of the shovel and brush, to follow the
      chimney-sweepers on May-day, through the dirty alleys of St. Giles's. His
      artificial wants were too many to be gratified by an even walk in the path
      of rectitude. When he saw that 'public principle' was an obstacle to the
      gratification of his vulgar vanity, he suppressed it&mdash;

      Notwithstanding this, he remained, secretly, a correspondent to the <i>Monthly
      Magazine</i>, and wrote for Sir Richard Phillips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vacating his place at Malta in favour of his brother-in-law, and coming
      back to seek his fortune, he scrambled about during a year and a half, in
      Doctors' Commons and among the booksellers, in search of employment, till
      he procured an engagement from the proprietors of <i>The Times</i> as a
      writer in that journal. His labours in this way were ardent, but
      profitable to nobody but himself. On the return of Napoleon from Elba, the
      <i>ex-republican</i> became an admirer of privileged orders, and 'the
      right divine of kings to govern wrong'&mdash;glorified the thrones of the
      allied despots&mdash;fell flat on his face in worship of legitimacy&mdash;and
      affected a beatific vision of the political millenium in the restoration
      of the Bourbons. He soon honoured Napoleon with all the obnoxious
      designations the language could supply. He called him 'a villain, a
      wretch, a rebel, a brigand, a traitor, a fiend, a felon, an incendiary, an
      impostor, an assassin, a viper, a demon, a fool, a living Moloch, a bloody
      dog, and a blackamoor.' * To these and hundreds of other names, he
      prefixed innumerable epithets expressive of disgust and hate. Every one
      but himself saw that such a course must shortly end. The <span

      being forcibly reminded of the cursing of Trim in <i>Tristram Shandy</i>,
      ridiculed Slop's <i>Execratory</i>, in a little piece intituled
      'Buonaparte -phobia; or, <i>Cursing made Easy, &amp;c</i>. by Dr. Slop.' *
      It not only insured to him the name of SLOP for ever, but hastened what
      was neither intended nor anticipated, his dismissal from <i>The Times</i>.

      The persecution of the French Protestants on the restoration of Louis
      XVIII. and their massacre at <i>Nismes</i>, occasioned the English
      Protestants to interest themselves heartily for their relief. The
      Committee of Dissenters at Dr, Williams's <i>Library in Red-Cross-street</i>
      inquired into the facts, published a verifying Report, and took measures
      for sending pecuniary succours. Seeking to earn the wages of his
      prostitution by slavering the hoof of tyranny, and maddened that Bourbon
      bigotry should be obstructed in its operation, Slop denied the truth of
      the statements, vilified the whole body of English Dissenters, imputed
      their humanity to unworthy and scandalous motives, and threw as many
      daring fabrications as his mercenary pen could create in the way of their
      efforts. With undaunted audacity he gave the lie direct to his
      father-in-law, Sir Henry Moncreiff Wellwood, who, in the kindness and
      courage of his heart, became President of a Public Meeting at Edinburgh,
      and inspirited the Protestants of Scotland to co-operate in a national
      subscription for the persecuted. When Slop's slanders were successfully
      repelled, and his artful falsehoods exposed, he withdrew without
      evidencing any other regret than what arose from his having been unable to
      effect his unhallowed purposes.

      His first exploit after his expulsion from <i>The Times</i> was, an
      attempt to delude the public by engrafting himself upon a <i>quacking</i>
      newspaper, now known, like himself, by a two-fold name, it being
      indiscriminately called 'The Muck Times,' and 'The Slop Pail.' The
      imposition succeeded only with a few. His writing gave the lie direct to
      his puffing pretensions, and his falsehoods were exposed in the paper from
      which he had been discharged. * He knows full well,' says <i>The Times</i>
      ( in February, 18]7) that 'his articles were rejected <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link201" id="link201"></a><a href="../44520-page-images/p201.jpg">201</a></span>from
      our columns on account of the virulence and indiscretion with which they
      were written; and that, for more than twelve months preceding, whatever
      articles attracted notice by their merit, were exclusively the productions
      of other gentlemen.&mdash;<i>There are in the office, sacks full of his
      rejected writings</i>; which, if they were published, would exhibit an
      accurate criterion of his puffed-off abilities; <i>the sale of our Journal
      increased the more, the less he wrote; and since he has ceased from
      writing altogether, has extended with a rapidity of which we have known no
      example, since we have had the management of it</i>. This and other
      statements were stunning blows to him, and remained unnoticed, because
      they were unanswerable.

      His overweening pride received another shock through his new friends the
      <i>legitimates</i>. He went to Paris, and applied to be introduced at
      court; but 'The Bourbon' refused to receive him! Yes! refused to receive
      him&mdash;Slop; that Slop who, to gain the favour of his Most Christian
      Majesty, when he was in England, had 'tainted himself with the plague-spot
      of Legitimacy, till he was leprous all over; in whose inmost soul it had
      fixed its mortal sting, and, like an ugly spider, entangled him in its
      slimy folds, brooding on him as on its own poison.' ** He&mdash;who had
      abandoned principle, was abandoned by friends, had incurred the world's
      contempt, and had sold himself to the devil in the service of legitimacy&mdash;<i>he</i>
      to be refused permission to bow over the hand of Louis XVIII!&mdash;<i>he</i>
      to be despised and rejected by that same Louis who had received Mr.

      Harnessed with other hacks to the machine of tyranny, he must answer to
      the lash of the driver, and drag it along, or be trampled over. Smack went
      the whip, and on went Slop. To support the new order of things in France,
      it was necessary, in addition to the bayonets of foreigners, that the
      press there should be put under a censorship, and that the <i>free</i>
      press of England should make <span class="pagenum"><a name="link202"
      id="link202"></a><a href="../44520-page-images/p202.jpg">202</a></span>a
      monstrous experiment to write up the advantages of a shackled press in
      France. Dr. Slop undertook the task, and joining to himself another
      Doctor, the Poet Laureate, they united with persons of similar
      qualifications in France, and commenced operations by announcing a
      publication called the '<i>Correspondent</i>,' which was to appear at
      London in the English, and at Paris in the French language on the same
      day. It was conducted on the plan of a 'Class-meeting' among the
      Methodists, where each relates his 'experience.' But neither the French
      nor the English cared a <i>sous</i> about the political 'experience' of
      Doctor Slop, Doctor Southey, or the mad Viscount Chateaubriand. Besides,
      the Poet Laureate, instead of telling his own 'experience,' told, a long
      story about the Rev. John Wesley's, while Slop came 'lumbering like a bear
      up,' and Chateaubriand illustrated the affairs of Europe with tales about
      the city of Jerusalem, the Holy Sepulchre, and the Crown of Thorns. The
      'Correspondent' fell still-born amid the laughter of the few people of
      both nations who knew of its coming forth, and perhaps there are only five
      persons in England who remember it even by name&mdash;Messrs. Longman,
      Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown, who had the honour of the profit and loss
      account.

      Devoid of political principle, Slop's real source of action is pure
      selfishness. His end and aim are antisocial, because his <i>Slop-pail</i>
      can only exist during political strife. He would inflame the passions of
      ministers and their minions, to vex and to harass the people, that the
      people may be irritated into resistance against persecution. He and his
      fellow-laboureres vilified and goaded whole communities of starving
      manufacturers. These unhappy men, congregated and organized into powerful
      bodies, simultaneously demanding a redress of wrongs and grievances, he
      exultingly recorded to have been dispersed and cut down by the sabres of
      the military &mdash;but not until he had so altered and 'garnished' the
      account of the massacre, furnished him by Orton, * as to make it pleasing
      to the depraved taste of his mindless readers, <span class="pagenum"><a

      serviceable to the political views of his base supporters. This was his
      harvest; but he has reaped that, and is sowing another.

      Public Subscription, in ridicule of her Majesty and her supporters. He
      communicated this design to Dr. Slop, who engaged heartily in the plan.
      Subscribers were advertised for, and were formed into a body, called 'The
      Loyal Association,' and Mr. Charles Bicknell, of No. 3, Spring Garden
      Terrace, the Solicitor to the Admiralty, was the Treasurer. Piggott wrote
      maudlin prose and wretched verse, and illustrated his unintellectual
      labours with coloured caricatures. These were issued to the world through
      a Publisher of Obscenity, while they were powerfully puffed by Slop in his
      Slop-pail, and Piggott himself cringed, his way to Court, and presented
      the talentless trash to his Majesty in person, who received it most
      graciously; and, as an encouragement to his labours, subscribed for forty
      sets of one of his works at a guinea each. But the public judgment refused
      the rinsings of the sycophant parson's brain; and the united efforts of
      'the Loyal Association' being inadequate to produce a single article of
      ability from the press, they turned their thoughts towards an attack upon
      the Press itself. They were deplorably 'poor in the spirits and minds of
      men,' but 'their purses, and counters, and ledgers,' were productive, and
      at one of their meetings they abandoned the project of a Series of
      Publications, and determined to commence a Series of Prosecutions. The
      notorious John Reeves, a plentifully-endowed placeman, who had thrown the
      country into a state of alarm by a Loyal Association in 1793, entered into
      these views; but, as the term Loyal had acquired an unfavourable odour,
      they changed their name from 'the Loyal Association,' to 'the
      Constitutional Association.' Piggott's Treasurer, Mr. Bicknell, with John
      Reeves (both lawyers), got Sir John Sewell (also a lawyer), a pensioner in
      the Red Book, to become the president of the confederacy. They appointed
      Charles Murray (another lawyer), their 'Honorary Secretary', a very
      acceptable post to a hungry attorney, who had quartered part of his family
      in public situations. He eagerly <span class="pagenum"><a name="link204"
      id="link204"></a><a href="../44520-page-images/p204.jpg">204</a></span>embraced
      the office of their Old-Bailey Solicitor; it brought him fees, and perhaps
      he expected it might bring him clients. They were joined by Longueville
      Clarke (also a lawyer), and the son of a person holding an appointment in
      a Government Establishment. John Poynder (also a lawyer) resident in
      Bridewell, to which, as well as Bethlem (two other Government
      Establishments), he is Clerk and Attorney, had been compelled to resign
      his office of Secretary to the Bible Society, and was at full leisure to
      become an active confederate. Intercourse with the prisoners in Newgate
      had given a certain turn to his views; a drinker of port wine himself, he
      had descanted, before a Committee of the House of Commons, on the
      wickedness of common gin; with a good comfortable house over his head, at
      the public expense, he had disturbed poor old apple-women who sought an
      independent living 'in summer's heat and winter's cold he had also a
      horror, upon public principle, of street organs in the evening; and, like
      his friend Slop, he had experienced the mortification of having his
      defamatory, and 'mewling and puling' writings rejected by '<i>The Times</i>'&mdash;the
      new concern was quite to his taste. Slop (himself a lawyer) became the
      Horn-boy of the Gang,&mdash;to blow the 'great news,' the 'extraordinary
      new's,' of their proceedings&mdash;to puff their attacks upon the Free
      Press of the People&mdash;to assist in raising the flame of alarm
      throughout the country&mdash;and to give the earliest intelligence of
      their Prosecutions. This paid Slop well, for the trouble he had with
      Parson Solomon, in laying the Plot; for, as the adherents to it increased,
      they took especial care to give their support and influence to the
      hireling paper, from whence Slop derives the means of supporting his
      tawdry existence. By these measures, the weak-minded were terrified out of
      subscriptions for anti-social objects; and the selfish crew having
      gathered around them the chief priests, and the pharisees, and some of the
      fattest amongst the placeholders, pensioners, and tax-eaters, who exist
      upon the people's labour, they fitted up an office at Walker's Hotel, No.
      6, New Bridge Street, Blackfriars, for the purpose of more conveniently
      carrying on the imposture. From this 'Den' they put forth a specious
      Address, which is rendered into pretty intelligible language in subsequent
      pages of this publication. *

      'Hone,' a gibe at 'the Whig Radicals headed by his grace the Duke of

      The article, so called, can be easily manufactured by a tailor and a
      dancing-master, and a few lessons in the school of Chesterfield. A head,
      powdered and erect, a solemn stalk, a bow to people of certain rank, the
      cut to people of another rank, and an affected condescension to those
      termed inferiors, will procure any man the reputation of being genteel,
      among the groundlings. Such gentlemen as these swarm in shoals, from the
      <i>Bridge-Street-Gang Informer</i> to the Marquess secretary for foreign
      affairs; the appearances that constitute these personages are usual and
      essential to every adventurer.

      integrity, he lost his selfrespect. Attacking the honesty he secretly
      envies, and has not the courage to imitate, he has nothing to compensate
      him for a comfortless mind, but an empty consequence among fools and
      knaves, which yields no repose. His appearance in the Slop-pail is
      ludicrous. Affecting a semblance to which he has no real pretension, he
      looks like a nightman in a cocked hat, who pulls up his frill at every
      discharge of muck, to show his gentility. His case is a common one. He
      rose from the bottom of society by foul self-inflation, and floats a
      filthy bubble among the scum upon the surface.

    <p>
      A minion of ministers, a parasite to despotism throughout the world,
      public virtue is the object of his unprincipled hate and unsparing abuse.
      Hence, there is not a 'public principle' that his mendacity has not
      'perverted;' not a man of disinterested public conduct that he has not
      vilified; not a measure of advantage to the country, emanating from such
      men, that he has not derided; not a measure of ministerial profligacy that
      he has not promoted; not a public job that he has not bolstered; not a
      public knave that he has not shielded; not an inroad upon the constitution

      DR. SLOP'S OBSCENITY.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Slop-pail report of the Attorney-General's Speech (in the House of
      Commons) the 3rd of July (1821), makes that officer say, that 'Horatio
      Orton' went to King's shop to buy an INDECENT Caricature.' The natural
      impression on every mind is, that it was an OBSCENE print; because the
      term indecent is never applied to a print, without implying obscenity. It
      was not only quite in character for <i>Slop</i>, who amused his readers
      with the obscenity of 'FRESH FIG-LEAVES FOR ADAM AND EVE,' but it suited
      his purpose as a Member of the Bridge-Street Gang, to fix OBSCENITY upon a
      political caricature. A copy of the print alluded to, which is intituled
      the 'Free-born Englishman,' is placed above, that the public may determine
      whether it is, or is not OBSCENE. Every one who looks at it will naturally
      be astonished at the impudence of the imputation, and some perhaps be
      induced to call the utterer by that short but natural appellation which no
      honest man in society ever applied but to a miscreant, who ought to have
      it burnt in upon his forehead as a mark to avoid him by. A 'curtain'
      before this print, to save Slop from the infamy its appearance brands him
      with, would be more serviceable to him now, than, it is to be hoped, his
      'CURTAIN BEFORE POTIPHARS WIFE' was amusing to his readers,

    <h3>
      ADDRESS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      [<i>The following is a Parody upon the 'Address' OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL
      ASSOCIATION, a nefarious Conspiracy for creating alarm in the minds of the
      timid, and obtaining money upon false pretences. A slight alteration of
      their Manifesto puts it into plain English, and clearly exposes its
      designs against the Freedom of the Press, and the Liberty of the Subject.</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      The prevalence of loyalty on constitutional principles, among certain
      classes, is, unhappily for us, too notorious to admit of doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Possessing, as this nation does, an Administration, which is the
      bottle-holder to the prize-fighters for the world&mdash;at peace with a
      standing army quartered throughout the country&mdash;covered with the
      expenses of a long, an artful, and trumpetted contest&mdash;enjoying a
      continual enlargement of the Statutes at Large, and variorum editions of
      Burns' Justice&mdash;and subjected to the wild and eternal palaverment of
      Derry Down Triangle&mdash;it might have been hoped, that all pranks and
      sprees would have ended in an humble attitude for such unexampled
      blisterings, without an unsightly and merciless exposure of his foreign
      presents.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that this is far from being the case, and that, on the contrary, a
      spirit of hostility exists against our most secret and profitable
      Prostitutions, we have only to appeal to the new uniforms, and the
      humorous law-yell Addresses, which have of late been laid at the foot of
      the throne by snug corporations, and meetings of Invisibles. Framed by
      bodies of men of indifferent parts, without concert or communication, and
      containing assertions drawn from active imagination and fiction, these
      Addresses indisputably prove&mdash;at twice&mdash;the lamentable existence
      of Liberty, and its fearful extent; they prove, that it menaces, not the
      predominance of this or that borough, but the safety of Boroughmongering
      itself; not the separate value of this or that puff, but the security of
      the whole bottle of smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consequences which have already resulted from the propagation of
      public principle, are but too obvious. Among them are to be numbered a
      daily and weekly bond of union between the humbler ranks of society, and
      their natural guardians and protectors&mdash;independence&mdash;disregard
      of mere jaw&mdash;and frequent attempts to obstruct our botheration&mdash;increased
      sale of <i>The Times</i>&mdash;renunciations of respect for the greatest
      humbugs in the country&mdash;hatred <span class="pagenum"><a name="link213"
      id="link213"></a><a href="../44520-page-images/p213.jpg">213</a></span>of
      hypocrisy&mdash;querulous impatience of unjust control and illegal
      restraint&mdash;ridicule of vain and ostentatious pretenders to all sound
      learning, experience, and knowledge&mdash;interruption of the courses of
      Sir Manasseh Masseh Lofez, and derangement of the great concerns and
      enterprizes of the Court Newsmen during the Coronation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Press, that great and abominable bore to paw-paw life&mdash;that
      interesting machine for diffusing the scent of the Slop-pail, has
      unhappily become, in the hands of the tax-payers, a lever, to shake the
      very foundations of our order. Its power, which within the last century
      has been multiplied a hundred fold, may now be said to reign paramount
      over vice; and to those friends to themselves, who dig deep into the fat
      of the land, it cannot but be matter of serious alarm to observe, that a
      very large proportion of our periodical publications is under the
      direction either of avowed enemies of the close boroughs, or of persons
      whose sole principle of action is opposed to our own private and self-sell
      interest. Every heart and voice is employed with daily increasing boldness
      to render the people acquainted with the proceedings of the
      borough-mongers&mdash;to show them that they are not represented by those
      whom they have not elected&mdash;to seduce them from their long affliction
      and allegiance to our sovereignty; and finally, to bring about a
      Reformation, on which the prosperity, the internal happiness, and the
      political greatness of the empire, must inevitably be established&mdash;and
      our interests be sacrificed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it is clear, that isolated and single-handed exertion is utterly
      inadequate to more than a grope at the good things arising from the
      present state of disorder, and that we should not, perhaps, get a mouthful
      a-piece; so it is to be feared, that the government and legislature might
      render our contest for them difficult, without an active, zealous, and
      persevering botheration against the reformingly disposed individuals of
      the community, which botheration, to be effectual, must be a running fire,
      and a continued insult towards such individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Persuaded that by these means alone the said good things can be arrested;
      and feeling that to arrest them, if possible, is our bounden duty, the
      Members of this Society will immediately throw the country into alarm and
      riot; they have therefore adopted the following Resolutions:
    </p>
    <p>
      1st. That they will use their best exertions to maintain Mr. Murray, and
      to support the due execution of his law.
    </p>
    <p>
      2nd. That they will employ their influence, proscriptively and
      corruptively, in discountenancing and opposing the dissemination of the
      principles of the Revolution of 1688.
    </p>
    <p>
      3rd. That they will encourage persons of temerity in the twitterary world
      to exert their nullabilities in diluting the sophistries, circulating the
      illusions, and disposing of the falsehoods which are necessarily employed
      by the Committee of this Association to mislead the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      4th That they will resort to such expedients as Mr. Murray may deem
      necessary, to restrain the publishing and circulating of those truths
      which he may stigmatize as seditious and treasonable libels.

      href="../44520-page-images/p214.jpg">214</a></span>wishing that the Press
      should be securely chained, the Members of this Society have no desire to
      limit their own bother. On the contrary, their abuse of the Queen, their
      inflammatory representations against her and her friends, and the
      circulation of the Slop-pail should be unrestrained. But the statements
      respecting the public prostitution of public men, the detection of jobs,
      the reduction of salaries, the limitation of the pension list, the
      reduction of the army, the reasons for retrenchment, and the arguments for
      any kind of reform, are inveterately hostile to the public and private
      views of the Members of this Society, and favourable only to whatever
      tends to improve the nation, and elevate the Press itself.&mdash;This
      system must be suppressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Association is established on the broad principle of opposing the
      attempts now made to overthrow the abuses crept into the civil
      institutions of the State. It has, therefore, been determined,
    </p>
    <p>
      1st. To establish a Fee Fund for the use and application of Mr. Murray, as
      he shall see fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      2nd. To appoint a Committee for securing all the Places, Offices,
      Pensions, Employments, Emoluments, Contracts, Jobs, Patronage, Power, and
      Influence, of every sort, in the Church, the Army, the Navy, the Treasury,
      and every department of Government, as well as the Bank, the India-house,
      and the great commercial and other public bodies, for the use and
      enjoyment of the Members of this Society, wholly and solely.
    </p>
    <p>
      3rd. To adopt a system of Correspondence with those members who live at a
      distance, and to establish Associations throughout the country, for the
      purpose of procuring Information of all kinds concerning the conduct and
      connexions of all persons who will not co-operate in these objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most earnestly, therefore, does this Society call upon all to whom a
      maintenance, out of the public purse, is dear, upon those who value the
      places they hold at the expense of the country, or the permanence of the
      present Administration, to join them in promoting these objects and
      principles. IF THE SOCIETY BE ONCE ESTABLISHED, it will be enabled to
      institute AN INQUISITION INTO THE PRIVATE CONCERNS OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL IN
      THE KINGDOM&mdash;turn the great body of the people into SPIES AND
      INFORMERS upon each other&mdash;and, by ANTI-SOCIALIZING THE WHOLE
      COMMUNITY&mdash;secure to the Society an ASCENDANCY IN CHURCH AND STATE,
      and an ultimate assumption of all THE FUNCTIONS OF GOVERNMENT. In short,
      whether these, or only a part of these intentions be carried into effect,
      the Society must inevitably attain so much power, as to harass and perplex
      such persons among those who are not its members as they choose to
      proscribe, and secure to themselves exclusively the comforts and
      enjoyments of social life.

    <h3>
      THE NEW DEVIL UPON TWO STICKS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Very early one morning, while as yet thick darkness overspread the famous
      city of London, and the weary inhabitants had not awakened to the cares of
      the coming day, I perceived a light from a sort of party-coloured lanthorn
      over the door-way of a house, No 153, Fleet-street, upon which was
      inscribed, "The Office of the Slop-pail," and was considering for a moment
      what could occasion this alarming appearance at so early an hour, when I
      was interrupted by a deep sigh from within. I at first thought it was a
      nocturnal illusion; but being interrupted again in the same manner, I took
      it for something real, and could not help crying out&mdash;"What devil is
      it that sighs here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is I, good Sir," answered a voice which had something in it of cynical
      querulousness; "I have been confined in the <i>Slop-pail</i> for some
      months past, against my will. In this house lives Dr. Slop."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Slop!" I exclaimed, "what my political godchild?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! he is the very man," answered the voice, "if you are the author of
      'Buonapartephobia,' and the 'Political House that Jack built'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And <span class="pagenum"><a name="link216" id="link216"></a><a
      href="../44520-page-images/p216.jpg">216</a></span>they call him Punch. He
      is the jest of special pleaders&mdash;possesseth the counsel with mirth,
      and attends the judges. But <i>my</i> business lies another way; I am the
      maker of charitable societies, a promoter of social order, the inventor of
      new methods for keeping the world quiet; in a word, I am the soul of the
      celebrated Devil upon two Sticks, the <i>domon of Luxury</i>, the <i>Political
      Cupid</i>: what sort of a personage I am, you shall see, if you please to
      set me at liberty to rejoin my body, which is now either in John-street or
      Shorter's-court."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good <i>Mr. Cupid</i>," I replied, "I should be happy to serve you, but
      the <i>Slop-pail</i> in which you are hidden, is abominably filthy; and,
      in my endeavours to relieve you, I may be stifled with the stench:
      besides, you may be, for aught I know, as base a hypocrite as the conjuror
      that confines you. I should wish to know how you got in, and by what power
      he holds you, if you are not as vile as he is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, do not leave me! For the sake of humanity release me," screamed the
      <i>Spirit</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had scarcely uttered these words, when Dr. Slop, accompanied by the <i>body</i>
      of the dæmon, suddenly appeared; and taking the lid off his Slop-pail, the
      Spirit exultingly flew out, and entered his own proper person. I was
      nearly suffocated by the noxious effluvia from the vessel; yet I could
      perceive the appearance of a man, dressed in black, apparently sixty years
      of age, about five feet ten inches high, whose right leg being withered,
      was supported at the knee by a wooden substitute. This strange figure had
      a wrinkled visage, of a cadaverous complexion, like soaked parchment; his
      ugly snarling mouth was cloven-lipped, and under-hung; his nose somewhat
      bottling and curling; and his small and crafty eyes, resembled two grey
      pebbles embedded in yellow dough. The top of his head was bald; the hair
      at the back and sides, thin, and cut short, was pomatumed and powdered. He
      supported himself by a crutch, which appeared to me, a gallows; and
      crossing Fleet-street with rapid strides, this <i>New Devil upon two
      Sticks</i>, ascending the steps of Walker's Hotel, by the aid of Dr. <i>Slop</i>,
      was received with loud acclamations and open arms by the <i>Bridge-Street
      Gang</i>, who awaited the arrival of their commander at his <i>Den</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I <span class="pagenum"><a name="link217" id="link217"></a><a
      href="../44520-page-images/p217.jpg">217</a></span> am," I replied. "But
      pray how came you in the Slop-pail?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ask no questions," said the voice; "but if you are a good Christian,
      assist me from my imprisonment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you?" I inquired, somewhat confused at this uncommon adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am a <i>dæmon</i>," replied the voice, "and you are come very
      opportunely to free me from a slavery where I languish in idleness, though
      <i>I am the most active and indefatigable devil in hell</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      I was somewhat affrighted at these words; but being naturally courageous,
      I recollected myself; and, in a resolute tone, thus addressed myself to
      the <i>Infernal</i> within:&mdash;"Good <i>Mr. Devil!</i> pray inform me
      by what character you are distinguished amongst your brethren; are you a
      devil of distinction, or an ordinary one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am," replied the voice, "a very considerable devil; and am more
      distinguished in this city, and in the other world, than any other
      perhaps."
    </p>
    <p>
      I replied, "You may be the daemon which we call Jonatkins."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," replied the spirit; "he is the tormentor of the Livery."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you then Turtle?" I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fie!" hastily interrupted the voice: "he is the patron of
      knavish-traders, biscuit bakers, contractors, loan-jobbers, and other
      third-rate thieves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear devil!&mdash;it may be you are Sid.?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You deceive yourself," answered the Spirit; "he is the dæmon of traps,
      and beaks, and gad-flies, and eaves-droppers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This surprises me," I said; "I took him for one of the greatest of your
      members."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is one of the least," replied the dæmon; "you have no true notion of
      our hell."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must, then," replied I, "be either Derry Down Triangle, or the
      Waterloo-Man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! as for those," said the voice, "they are devils of the first rank;
      they are the court spirits; they enter into the councils of princes,
      animate their ministers, form leagues, stir up insurrections in states,
      and light up the torches of war: these are not such boobies as the first
      you mentioned to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! tell me, I entreat you," said I, "what post has Diabolus Regis?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is the froth of the law, the mere foam of the bar," replied the <span

      WHERE SHALL I DINE?
    </h3>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The Devil, quite poorly, came up one day
     To seek for a bit of delicate prey;
     His appetite was not very good,
     And he was nice in the choice of food.

     He had bolted Attorneys till he was sick,
     And still they were served up fast and thick&mdash;
     Barristers follow'd, so thick and fast,
     He thought he should never see the last.

     Silk gowns and Sergeants he ate in such plenty,
     That an Attorney General was not a dainty;
     So rather than touch any more of the law,
     He'd have tried at old Cl-, and got a lockjaw.

     Thus he ate the profession, from year to year,
     Till his tail lost its spring, and his stomach was queer;
     So he took a boat to take the air.
     And landed at Bridge-street, and paid his fare.

     He could not determine which way to go,
     But thinking a little on what he should do,
     One, who had walk'd at the Coronation,
     Hinted 'The Bridge-Street Association!'
</pre>
    <p>
      'Ho! ho!' said he, 'I forgot!' and his tail Whisk'd about with delight; 'I
      shall <i>now</i> have a meal!
    </p>
    <p>
      'First there's Murray, ah! ah!&mdash;and to take off the taste 'Of the <i>lawyer</i>&mdash;I'll
      give him an exquisite baste.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then there's Sharp!&mdash;what a treat! I must speak to the cook!&mdash;'And
      Sewell! Reeves! Bicknell! Clarke! Reynolds! Price! Brook! 'Bridges!
      Flower! Sikes! Atkins! Jacks! Poynder! Slop! Croly!&mdash;'By my hoof I
      shall <i>dine</i>&mdash;and at night I'll be jolly!'
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     He kick'd the door open&mdash;the place being warm,
     Tickl'd his <i>lowness's</i> nose to a charm;
     When bolted inside, not a soul can say
     What he did, but&mdash;there was 'the devil <i>to pay!</i>'
     Most awful to hear were the yells and the riot,
     Yet awfuller far was the sudden quiet:
     No doubt with the den he is having his swing,
     When he's out, let us shout&mdash;'God save the King!'

      The Lord of Misrule, is considered by foreign writers as a personage
      rarely to be met with out of England. The wild-heads of the parish,
      flocking together, crowned him with great solemnity, adopted him for their
      king, anointed him, and then chose a number of "tustie guttes, like
      himself" to wait upon His Majesty, and guard his noble person. These he
      invested with green, yellow, and other colours; and as though they were
      not gaudy enough, they bedecked themselves with scarfs, ribbons, and
      laces, adding gold rings, precious stones, and other jewels. They also had
      hobby-horses, dragons, and other whimsies, and with piping and drumming,
      and bells jingling, they skirmished their hobby-horses, and other monsters
      among the throng, and <i>went to church</i>, the people staring, laughing,
      and fleering, and mounted upon forms to see the pageant.&mdash;Strutt's

      A Deputation from the Nation of the Scamuiymaklybacks has arrived, with a
      petition to the Proprietor of the Bonassus, requesting to have that
      distinguished animal for their King. Should the Bonassus leave this
      country, it is expected that the Rev. S. Piggott will anoint him with
      Treacle, previous to his departure, after which, the National air will be

      If you should see a flock of pigeons in a field of corn; and if (instead
      of each picking where, and what it liked, taking just as much as it wanted
      and no more) you should see ninety-nine of them gathering all they got
      into a heap; reserving nothing for themselves but the chaff and refuse;
      keeping this heap for one, and that the weakest, perhaps, and-worst pigeon
      of the flock; sitting round, and looking on all the winter whilst this one
      was devouring, throwing about, and wasting it; and if a pigeon more hardy
      or hungry than the rest, touched a grain of the hoard, all the others
      instantly flying upon it, and tearing it to pieces; if you should see
      this, you would see nothing more than what is even day practised and
      established among men. Among men, you see the ninety-and-nine toiling and
      scraping together a heap of superfluities for one; getting nothing for
      themselves all the while, but a little of the coarsest of the provision,
      which their own labour produces (and this one, too, oftentimes the
      feeblest and worst of the whole set, a child, a woman, a madman or a
      fool); looking quietly on, while they see the fruits of all their labour
      spent or spoiled; and if one of them take or touch a particle of it, the
      others join against him, and hang him for the theft.&mdash;Paley's Moral
      Philosophy, b.iii.c. 1.

      grateful thanks to his numerous Patrons, who have enabled him to divide
      the town for so many days, as it is doubtful which Exhibition has been
      most admired, the Exhibition at Westminster, or that in the Strand. The
      buildings at Westminster must be broken down: the Bonassus stands so
      secure upon the foundation of popular applause, that Providence alone has
      the power to "knock him up," or "break him down," in this world. The
      soldiers and sailors, heroes of Trafalgar and Waterloo, will be admitted
      to see the Bonassus at half-price, until Thursday, when the Abbey closes,

      VICTORY OF PETERLOO.
    </h3>
    <p>
      A MONUMENT is proposed to be erected in commemoration of the achievements
      of the MANCHESTER YEOMANRY CAVALRY, on the 16th August, 1819, against THE
      MANCHESTER, MEETING of Petitioners for Redress of Wrongs and Grievances,
      and Reform in Parliament. It has been called a <i>battle</i>, but
      erroneously; for, the multitude <i>was unarmed</i>, and made no resistance
      to the heroes <i>armed</i>; there was no contest&mdash;it was a <i>victory</i>;
      and has accordingly been celebrated in triumph. This event, more important
      in its consequences than the Battle of Waterloo, will be recorded on the
      monument, by simply stating the names of the officers and privates
      successfully engaged, on the one side; and on the other, the names of the
      persons killed, and of the six hundred maimed and wounded in the attack
      and pursuit; also the names of the captured, who are still prisoners in
      His Majesty's goals; with the letter of thanks, addressed to the victors,
      by His Majesty's Command.

      that Meagher's Trumpet shall be melted down, and that the brass shall be
      carefully applied to the purpose of multiplying an appropriate design to
      be distributed among the warriors who distinguished themselves on the
      occasion, and to be worn by each as a PETERLOO MEDAL.

      Her Majesty <i>died by the dagger of Persecution</i>. Her Persecutors,
      unable to conceal the fact that <i>she has been hurried to her Grave</i>,
      hypocritically whine over "the wounds themselves have made," and, like the
      flying felon, who, to elude his pursuers, cries "Stop thief!" they huddle
      up their knives, and charge her friends and advisers with being her
      destroyers! "<i>Kissing the gashes that bloodily do yawn upon their faces</i>,"
      they call her defenders and protectors "a faction" and charge this <i>faction</i>
      with being her assassins! Execrable villains! Was it this "faction"
      brought her from Germany? Was she <i>married</i> by this "faction?" Were

      that in her person the Principles of Humanity and the Constitution were
      invaded., reflecting on <i>her</i> sufferings and their own, and aroused
      by a sense of duty and of danger, united for her preservation. Animated by
      the Justice of their cause, and <i>headed by</i> the Press, they read a
      moral lesson to her deadly persecutors, at which they turned pale, and
      from which they shrunk back in dismay! The archers shot her sorely, but
      the People saved her from swift destruction. This offence was never to be
      forgiven. They who had elevated the Queen above the craft of <i>Priestianity</i>
      and the cruelty of <i>Court Selfishness</i>, were more exposed to attack
      than her whom they had preserved. Her enemies rallied to assail her
      friends. If we seek the names of the assailants from among the Members of
      the Bridge-Street Gang, a formidable list might be selected. There we
      should find the slanderous Blacow, and at the head of the muster-roil
      might be placed Slop. This "<i>wretch</i>" and his Gang, commenced <i>Prosecutions</i>
      against the humblest of the Queen's friends, while the <i>hireling</i>
      presses foamed into a settled <i>Persecution</i> against her and them. The
      Slop-pail frothed up its malignant spume; official poison <i>Croked</i>
      forth from the Courier; the organ of the <i>Fashionable World</i>
      discharged his filthy ribaldry; and the assaults of a band of <i>obscene
      wretches</i>, Sunday after Sunday, were defended and aided by the
      prostituted pen of Slop. In violation of the sanctity which even savages
      attach to <i>the chambers of death</i>, some of the heartless fiends who
      dogged her through life, and hurried her "<i>to the house appointed far
      all living</i>," pursue their remorseless warfare beyond the grave. Others
      (following the example of their abettors, who, in mockery of death itself,
      put the signs of mourning upon the outsides of their houses, while they
      chuckle with joy within), <i>now</i> that they have consummated their
      crime, make a merit of not preying upon her dead body! Her frame, too weak
      to bear <span class="pagenum"><a name="link230" id="link230"></a><a
      href="../44520-page-images/p230.jpg">230</a></span>their blows upon her
      heart, surrendered its mighty spirit into the hands of Him who gave it,
      and her murderers exclaim, "Well! she is <i>gone&mdash;at last</i>; let us
      bury all animosities <i>with her!</i>" BRUTAL TAUNT! They hoisted the
      black flag of unrelenting and deadly hate against her as long as she lived&mdash;they
      have exterminated her, and they hang out a white one, crying Peace! Peace!
      where there is no Peace! They have floated themselves to the favour of
      their employers in her blood, and the guilty villains, retreating to their
      den to celebrate their horrible triumph, pray us not to disturb their
      secret orgies with our clamours!
    </p>
    <p>
      It is said, that only a few hours before she ceased to breathe, she spoke
      of the modes her savage adversaries had successfully put in practice, of
      separating worthy people from her society: one of which was, <i>to deter
      them from visiting her, by propagating the most atrocious calumnies
      against her, and them</i>. Never was human being attacked with more
      malignant ferocity by <i>the Furies of the Press</i>, than this
      noble-minded and innocent lady&mdash;never will they perpetrate a fouler
      Murder! <i>Instruments of cruelty are in their habitations. O, my soul!
      come not thou into their secret!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Her dying declaration, "THEY HAVE DESTROYED ME!" will be remembered long
      after her destroyers. Her blood is on their heads. They allowed her no
      peace on earth. <i>Now&mdash;she hears not the voice of the oppressor&mdash;she
      is where the wicked cease from troubling, and where the weary are at rest</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fixedness of courage immovable, in clearness of intellect unrivalled,
      she shone on earth as the polar-star in the firmament of her sex, and in
      her utmost need, they circled round her as the sun of their glory. Her
      wrongs and her fate are indelibly registered in our annals. Honest
      historians of after-times will narrate them truly, and unpensioned Bards
      embalm her to posterity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen's dying request was, to lie in the same tomb with her child&mdash;sad
      experience taught her to anticipate a refusal from her relentless enemies!

      THE DEATH-LIGHT OF CAROLINE'S HALL,
    </h3>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      The death-lights glimmer in Caroline's hall,
      Where strangers have spread the funeral pall;
      Relations by blood from her have fled,
      And other hands have pillow'd her head&mdash;
      Vet a halo round her temples plays,
      Brighter than earthly crowns can raise!
      When her heart-strings broke, no husband was there,
      With a bursting breast, and a holy prayer&mdash;
      Her Royal Spouse was <i>on the sea</i>,
      In glittering pomp and pageantry;
      With streamers pointing to Erin's shore,
      Where wassail, and wine, and wild uproar,
      And the noisy mirth of a motley band,
      Were to drown the sighs of a sorrowing land!
      The prospect was bright on her Bridal Day,
      And English hearts were light and gay;
      Alas!'twas the gleam of a wintry sky,
      When dark clouds come, and the storm is nigh.

      The eye to bless, and the hand to save,
      Were not the gifts that the altar gave!
      She never knew the sweet control
      That wins, that guards the cherish'd soul;
      But met the keen repulsive glance
      From furious eye-balls turn'd askance!&mdash;
      A <i>licensed outcast</i>, bade to roam,
      No husband's bed&mdash;no friend&mdash;no home&mdash;
      The treacherous <i>Spy</i> in ambush placed,
      Our British name defiled, disgraced!

<pre xml:space="preserve">
      At last kind Heaven upon her smiled&mdash;
      The raptured Mother clasp'd her Child;
      Maternal love beam'd from her eye;
      The tear-dew'd cheek <i>for once</i> was dry.
      But devilish hate could ne'er endure
      A joy so sweet, a bliss so pure;
      And the cherub-smile that cheer'd her life,
      Was rudely torn from the widow'd wife!

      But who shall tell&mdash;or who shall believe,
      That malice could deeper wrongs conceive?
      O, learn the deed from the daughter's bier&mdash;
      In Judgment bid her <i>Tomb</i> appear;
      On the dark vault let the day-beam shine;
      Behold the broken lincage-line!

      The Record rests on the sculptured stone&mdash;
      <i>Robb'd  of the Mother's name</i> alone.
      The surpliced Priest made no appeal&mdash;
      His Earthly Masters check'd his zeal&mdash;
      From those who bent their heads to Heaven,
      To pray that mortals be forgiven;
      No kind behest for her was sent,
      No Priestly hand to her was lent;
      But when, at length, she lifeless fell,
      Rose the <i>hollow</i> sound of <i>their</i> passing bell!
      Well fed, well paid, to blast her name,
      Swarms of Italian Monsters came;
      And English Monsters, fouler still,
      Obey'd their Masters' deadly will!
      The fiends have chased her day by day,
      Her <i>Sabbath</i> death-bed was their prey!&mdash;
      These are not men!&mdash;they never press'd
      The life-streams from a human breast;
      Nor are they woman-born&mdash;but thrown
      From some vile source to man unknown!
      She struggled long&mdash;she nobly rose
      Triumphant o'er her rancorous foes;
      Bravely she stood the lengthen'd strife
      For honest fame&mdash;more dear than life&mdash;
      But ah! the nerve, too finely strung,
      Was wrench'd, was torn, was rudely wrung&mdash;
      She won the prize&mdash;<i>that</i> strength was given,
      Then burst from earth to kinder Heaven!

      It is well known, that the Coronation Oil of the Kings of France was
      brought in a bottle from Heaven by an eagle, and from that fact called <i>Holy</i>
      Oil. During the Revolution, a Jacobin took the liberty of using the Holy
      Oil to grease his boots with, and the eagle not having arrived with a
      fresh supply, it is said that Louis XVIII. will remain uncrowned until
      that event, or until the fellow's boots can be found and the oil extracted
      and transferred to the head of His Most Christian Majesty. <span

  'Twas at that sober hour when the light of day is receding,
  I alone in Slop's Office was left; and, in trouble of spirit,
  I mused on old times, till my comfort of heart had departed.
  Pensile at least I shall be, methought&mdash;<i>sus. per coll.</i> surely!
  And therewithal felt I my neckcloth; when lo! on a sudden,
  There came on my eyes, hanging mid-way 'twixt heav'n and St. James's,
  The book call'd the <i>Pension List</i>. There did I see my name written,
  Yea ev'n in that great book of life! It was sweet to my eyelids,
  As dew from a tax! and <i>Infinity</i> seem'd to be open,
  And I said to myself, 'Now a blessing be on thee, my Robert!
  And a blessing on thee too my pen! and on thee too my sack-but!'
  Now, as thus I was standing, mine ear heard a rap at the street-door,
  Ev'n such as a man might make bold with, half gentle half footman;
  And lo! up the stairs, dotting one, one, after the other,
  Came the leg of a wonder, hop! hop! through the silence of evening;
  And then a voice snarling from the throat of the him they call Murray,
  Who said, as he hopp'd, 'Must the <i>Muck Times</i> be mournful at <i>all</i> times?
  Lo, SLOP, I've a sop, for your mop; yes&mdash;hop! hop! I've a <i>story</i>,
  With which I'll light <i>you</i> up, if you'll light me, Slop, up another.'
  'Don't be so <i>bold!</i>  methought a <i>larking</i> voice from the skylight
  Answer'd, and therewithal I felt fear as of frightening;
  Knowing not why, or how, my soul seem'd night-cap to my body.
  Then came again the voice, but then with a louder squalling&mdash;
  'Go to hell,' said the voice. 'What!,' said I, inwardly, 'I go!'
  When lo, and behold, a great wonder!&mdash;I, I, Robert Southey,
  Even I, Robert Southey, Esquire, LL.D. Poet Laureate,
  Member of the Royal Spanish Academy, of the
  Ditto of history too, of the Institute Royal
  Of Dutchland, and eke of the Welch Cymmodorion wonder,
  Author of Joan of Arc, of much Jacobin Verse, and Wat Tyler,
  Et cætera, et caetera, et caetera, et cætera, et cætera,
  (For it's unknown all the things that I am, and have written),
  I, as I said before, ev'n I, by myself, I,
  Unlike, in that single respect, to my great master Dante,
  (For Virgil went with him to help him), but like in all others,
  Rush'd up into Paradise boldly, which angels themselves don't,
  Yea ev'n into Paradise rush'd I, through showers of <i>flimsies</i>,
  All as good as the Bank, and for hailstones I found there were <i>Sovereigns</i>,
  Spick and span new; and anon was a body all glorified,
  Even all the great Host both of Church and State, Crosses, Grand Crosses,
  Commanders, Companions, and Knights of all possible orders,
  Commons and Peers, the souls of the sold, whom Pensions made perfect,

    <p>
      Coronet, Crosier, and Mitre, in grand semicircle inclining,

    <p>
      Tier over tier they took their place, aloft in the distance,
    </p>
    <p>
      Far as the sight could pierce, Stars, Garters, and Gold Sticks.
    </p>
    <p>
      From among the throng bless'd, all full dress'd, in a Field Marshal's
      uniform, Rose one, with a bow serene, who, aloft, took his station;
    </p>
    <p>
      Before him the others crouch'd down, all inclining in concert,
    </p>
    <p>
      Bent like a bull-rush sea, with a wide and a manifold motion:
    </p>
    <p>
      There he stood in the midst alone; and in front was the presence,
    </p>
    <p>
      With periwig curling and gay, and a swallow-cut coat-tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hear ye of long ears! Lo! in that place was <i>Canning</i>,
    </p>
    <p>
      He who strengthens the Church and State, with his Manton's hair-triggers,
      And sneers on his lips, and eyes leering, and <i>rupturous</i> speeches;
    </p>
    <p>
      With him Fletcher Franklin I saw, and Sir Robert, my namesake,
    </p>
    <p>
      Worthy the name! even Baker, Sir Robert, of Bow-street;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Gifford, with face made of lachrymose, savage and feeble,
    </p>
    <p>
      Who delighteth with Croker to cut up men, women, and young men,
    </p>
    <p>
      And therefore did Hazlitt cut him up, and so he stood mangled.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, too, brocaded and satin'd, stood smiling and bowing,

    <p>
      With Court-mask'd appearance, the Fearful One, him of Triangle!

    <p>
      And there, too, the Foolish one, far-conscienced, the Doctor!

    <p>
      So that she fell in her grave, and said, 'Cover me kind earth!'

      Expecteth Milleniums, and laudeth the Blackguard of Blackwood's,

    <p>
      As if he had, under the chin been, by worshipful men, chuck'd;

    </p>
    <p>
      And the Court-newsman also was there&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      (The Spirit now bids me write prose, but that, you know's all the same
      thine;) And Colburn with his Muck Monthly Magazine was there;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Ward, the Animal Painter, with a piece of spoil'd canvas, 35 feet wide
      by 21, was there;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Bird who, most disloyally, died of a broken heart, was not there;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the Duke of Wellington, with the Sword of State, was there;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Sir John Silvester, the Recorder of London, and his assistant, were
      there; And Messrs. Uundell and Bridge, the Jewellers who repair'd the
      Crown, were there;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the Pigtails out off from his Majesty's guards were there;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the Guards themselves in their neat uniforms, and new white gaiters,
      were there;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the State Coach and Coachmen and Horses were there;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the other Ministers of State in their new State Liveries were there;
      And the Clerks of the Council and the two Silver Inkstands were there; And
      all the Gentlemen of the Stock Exchange were there;
    </p>
    <p>
      And all the Gentlemen of the Shipping Interest were there;
    </p>
    <p>
      And all the Gentlemen of the Landed Interest were there;
    </p>
    <p>
      But all the people without Interest were not there;
    </p>
    <p>
      And all the Peers who voted the Queen of England guilty were-there;
    </p>
    <p>
      And all the Ministerial Members of the House of Commons were there; And
      Dr. Slop with 'fresh fig-leaves for Adam and Ere' was there;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the Royal Proclamation against Vice and Immorality was pasted up
      there. And behold, while I read it, thinking to put it, excellent as it
      was, Into language still better,
    </p>
    <p>
      Methought, in my vision, I dreamt&mdash;dream within dream intercircled&mdash;And
      seem'd to be hurried away, by a vehement whirlwind,
    </p>
    <p>
      To Flames and Sulphurous Darkness, where certain of my Minor Poems were
      scorching,
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet unconsum'd, in penal fire; and so was I purified
    </p>
    <p>
      For deeds done in the flesh, being, through them, burnt by proxy!
    </p>
    <p>
      There, too, roasted the Bishop of Osnaburgh's Doxy,
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Righteous-one, <i>the Prince Bishop himself</i>, was in Heaven;
    </p>
    <p>
      And two Boots were there, as a burnt-offering for peccadillo,
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Owner thereof was a glorified spirit above,
    </p>
    <p>
      Where, as in duty bound, I had sung to him 'Twang-a-dillo,
    </p>
    <p>
      He that loves a pretty girl, is a hearty good fellow!'
    </p>
    <p>
      And in Torment (but here the blest rage of the bard returns on me)
    </p>
    <p>
      And in torment was She, who, on earth, had been also tormented By Him who
      is never, nor can be accused, of aught vicious;
    </p>
    <p>
      With her were the friends of my childhood&mdash;not leaving out Coleridge;
      And they who were kill'd by the Manchester Yeomanry also;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Truth, the whole Truth, nothing but the Truth, suffered the burning.
      Then I turn'd my meek eyes, in their gladness, to Heaven, and my place
      there, And ascending, I flew back to Paradise, singing of Justice;
    </p>
    <p>
      Where, fill'd with divine expectation of merited favour,
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link241" id="link241"></a><a
      href="../44520-page-images/p241.jpg">241</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The gathering host look'd to him, in whom all their hopes center'd,
    </p>
    <p>
      As the everlasting hand; and I, too, press'd forward to obtain&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      But old recollections withheld me;&mdash;down, down, dropp'd my sack-but,
      And my feet, methought, slid, and I fell precipitate. Starting,
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I awoke, with my hair up, and lo! my young days were before me, Dark
      yet distinct; but instead of the voice of the honest,
    </p>
    <p>
      I hoard only Murray's yap', yap! and hap! hop! through the silence of
      evening: Yap! hop! and hop! yap!&mdash;and hence came the hop, step, and
      jump, of my verses.

      BOROUGH-BRIDGE REFORM.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The the Ancient and Honourable Corporation of Boroughmongers, in
      Parlaverment assembled, THE PETITION of the Ancient and Honourable
      Corporation of London Bridge in Arches assembled,
    </p>
    <p>
      Hombly sheweth,
    </p>
    <p>
      That, for some time past, an opinion has prevailed, that your Petitioners'
      <i>Arches</i> are narrow and decayed, and that their continuance in their
      present state is attended with an unnecessary annual expense, and loss of
      lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      That, in consequence of this opinion, a large body of persons assembled
      for Bridge Reform, have insisted upon the necessity of widening your
      Petitioners' <i>Arches</i>, and have actually erected, in your
      Petitioners' neighbourhood, a new bridge, with arches calculated to give
      free course to the whole tide, and a safe and uninterrupted public
      communication&mdash;to the great scandal of your Petitioners.
    </p>
    <p>
      That your Petitioners' Arches, and the Borough Arches of your Honourable
      Structure, are the production of one and the same mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      That your Honourable Structure being a model of perfection, your
      Petitioners have, therefore, a right to presume that their Bridge is also
      a model of perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      That your Petitioners, respectfully referring to the enlightened
      declaration of the Emperor of Austria, that what is ancient is good,
      humbly beg leave to represent, that it is essential to the permanence of
      your Honourable Structure in its present state, to stop the progress of
      all enlargement.
    </p>
    <p>
      And your Petitioners humbly pray, that the Right Hon. George Canning may
      be assigned advocate in their behalf, to convince the Public that your
      Petitioners' Arches are exactly as numerous, as narrow, and as decayed as
      they ought-to-be; which office your Petitioners have no doubt the said
      Right Hon. Gent. will gladly undertake, upon being allowed to receive an
      ample toll.
    </p>
    <p>
      AND YOUR PETITIONERS, as in uniformity found, will ever pray for Your
      Honourable Structure.

      CHARLES WARREN, of CHESTER-PLACE, with the utmost diffidence, publicly
      announces his successful discovery. By the first application of his
      varnish to BOOTS, he saw his own face in them, with a Judge's wig on his
      head; and he assures his old friends, who he knows will take his word for
      it, that the reflection was so strong, it almost knocked him back. He
      earnestly desires their approbation, and solicits their favour in his new
      shop. He humbly begs they will support him as much as they can. His going
      round among strangers is insupportable to him, unless he can get a few of
      his former friends to accompany him.

      enough acquainted with the structure to undertake its RESTORATION, will be

      SCHOOLS FOR ALL.
    </h3>
    <p>
      USEFUL INSTRUCTION having hitherto been chiefly confined to the Productive
      Classes, and many in the Upper Ranks still remaining in a deplorable state
      of ignorance, it is intended to establish SCHOOLS FOR THE HIGHER ORDERS,
      in order that, by being equally well-informed with the rest of the
      community, the plea of ignorance may no longer be allowed as an excuse for
      want of knowledge in the duties of life. Further information may be had of
      the printer.

      UNIVERSAL SAFETY LAMP.
    </h3>
    <p>
      "One unclouded blaze of living light."
    </p>
    <p>
      THE COMBINATION AGAINST THIS LAMP renders it necessary to state some of
      its advantages. The best of the Common Parish Lamps, so universally
      complained of for their dulness, do little more than render darkness
      visible, and assist the perpetration of crime. If their forms are
      occasionally varied by lacquer and varnish, and rendered pleasing to the
      eye, their light is not improved in the smallest degree; and they require
      a multitude of hands to feed and trim them, at a most enormous expense;
      while THE "UNIVERSAL SAFETY" LAMP diffuses a brilliant and steady lustre,
      and a genial warmth equal to the solar beam. It eclipses every other
      brightness. The only inconvenience complained of by the nervous and
      fastidious is, that its flame sometimes rises during a storm, and emits a
      small portion of smoke, but this vapour ceases almost immediately after
      the agitation has subsided. <i>It is constructed on an unerring principle
      of Self-regulation; it cannot be extinguished by any power on earth, and
      will Last for Ever</i>. <span class="pagenum"><a name="link245"

      A CAUTION.
    </h3>
    <p>
      A SLOW BUT SURE POISON, which gradually insinuates itself into the system,
      and will utterly destroy a human being, is now making frightful ravages.
      Its common name is CANT. Some <i>blacks</i> deliver it in the lump, and a
      certain <i>lawyer</i> has been seen to part with it in the form of
      globules. It is most subtle when laminated, and unfortunately is to be
      found in that state spread over a large portion of the community. NOTICE
      IS HEREBY GIVEN, that the effluvia from the infected is contagious.
    </p>
    <p>
      N. B. The most certain symptom of the presence of the poison is,
      prostration of mind.

     He 'turn'd his back upon himself
     And straight to 'Lunnun' came,
     To two two-sided Lawyers
     With tidings of the same,
     That our own land must 'prostrate stand'
     Unless we praise his name&mdash;
     For his  practical' comfort and joy!

     "Go fear not," said his L-p
     "Let nothing you affright;
     "Go draw your quills, and draw six Bills,
     "Put out yon blaze of light:
     "I'm able to advance you,

     The Lawyers at those tidings
     Rejoiced much in mind,
     And left their friends a-staring
     To go and raise the wind,
     And straight went to the Taxing-men
     And said "the Bills come find&mdash;
     "For 'fundamental' comfort and joy!

     The Lawyers found majorities
     To do as they did say,
     They found them at their mangers
     Like oxen at their hay,
     Some lying, and some kneeling down,
     All to L&mdash;d C&mdash;h
     For his  practical' comfort and joy!

     With sudden joy and gladness
     Rat G&mdash;ff&mdash;d was beguiled,
     They each sat at his L-p's side,
     He patted them and smiled;
     Yet C&mdash;pi&mdash;y, on his nether end,
     Sat like a new born Child,&mdash;
     But without either comfort or joy!

     He thought upon his Father,
     His virtues and his fame,
     And how that father hoped from him
     For glory to his name,
     And as his chin dropp'd on his breast,
     His pale cheeks burn'd with shame:&mdash;

      THE DOCTOR
    </h3>
    <h3>
      A PARODY WRITTEN BY THE RIGHT HONORABLE GEORGE CANNING, M. P.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Lord FOLKESTONE confessed that there Had been a smile on his countenance
      at one part of the right honorable gentleman (Mr. CANNING)'s speech, and
      it seemed to him very extraordinary, even after the reconciliation that
      had taken place, to hear the right honorable gentleman stand up for the
      talents of that poor "Doctor" (Lord SIDMOUTH), who has so long been the
      butt of his most bitter and unsparing ridicule (<i>loud laughter and
      shouts of hear, hear</i>). Whether in poetry or prose, the great object of
      his derision, and that for want of ability and sense, was the noble lord
      whom he (Mr. CANNING) had so strenuously defended that night; and now
      forsooth, he wondered that any person could object to confide unlimited
      power in the hands of a person, according to his own former opinions, so
      likely to be duped and misled (hear, hear). Yes, the house would remember
      the lines in which, at different times, the right honorable gentleman (Mr
      CANNING), had been pleased to panegyrize his (Mr. CANNING's) noble friend
      (Lord SIDMOUTH) of which the following were not the worst:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "I showed myself prime Doctor to the country;
     My ends attain'd, my only aim has been
     To keep my place, and gild my humble name."&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      (A laud laugh)
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, this was the view the right honorable gentleman had once drawn of his
      noble friend, who was then described by him thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My name's the Doctor; on the Berkshire hills," &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      [See the Parody below for the remainder of Lord Folkestone's Quotation&mdash;For
      his Lordship's Speech, see Evans's Debates, 1817, p. 1568.]
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     My name's THE DOCTOR; on the Berkshire hills
     My father purged his patients&mdash;a wise man,
     Whose constant care was to increase his store,
     And keep his eldest son&mdash;myself&mdash;at home.
     But I had heard of Politics, and long'd
     To sit within the Commons' House, and get
     A place, and luck gave what my sire denied.

     Some thirteen years ago, or ere my fingers
     Had learn'd to mix a potion, or to bleed,
     <i>I flatterd Pitt: I cring'd, and sneak'd, and faun'd,</i>
     And thus became the Speaker. I alone,
     With pompous gait, and peruke full of wisdom,
     Th' unruly members could control, or call The House to order.

     Tir'd of the Chair, I sought a bolder flight,
     And, grasping at his power, I struck my friend,
     Who held that place which now I've made my own.
     Proud of my triumph, I disdain'd to court
     The patron hand which fed me&mdash;or to seem
     Grateful to him who rais'd me into notice.

     And, when the King had call'd his Parliament
     With all my fam'ly crowding at my heels,
     My brothers, cousins, followers and my son,
     I show'd myself Prime Doctor to the country.

      TO THE READER
    </h3>
    <p>
      THE AUTHOR OF THE POLITICAL HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT, perceiving the
      multitude of attempts at Imitation and Imposture, occasioned by the
      unparalleled sale of that Jeu d'Esprit, injustice to the public and to
      himself, respect-fully states, that, induced by nearly forty years of the
      most confidential intimacy with Mr. HONE, and by the warmest friendship
      and affection for him and his family, he originally selected him for his
      publisher exclusively; that he has not suffered, nor will he suffer, a
      line of his writing to pass into the hands of any other Bookseller; and
      that his last, end owing to imperative claims upon his pen of a higher
      order, possibly his very last production in that way, will be found in The
      MAN IN THE MOON.

      This Publication was entered at Stationers' Hall, and Copies were duly
      delivered, according to Act of Parliament, one being for the British
      Museum; yet it is held in such estimation by all ranks, from the mansion
      to the cottage, including men of high classical and literary attainment,
      that it is coveted by eminent and learned bodies for the purpose of being
      preserved and deposited in the other National Libraries, as appears by the

      A LETTER TO THE SOLICITOR GENERAL. By WILLIAM HONE.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the announcement of this Publication, the attack of the
      Solicitor-General upon the Juries of my Country has drawn down upon that
      Gentleman, within the walls of Parliament, such deserved animadversion as
      to render superfluous any interference on my part.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two years have elapsed since I broke away from the toils; and it seems the
      escape of the destined victim is never to be forgiven! The cause of which
      the Solicitor-General is unexpectedly the gratuitous advocate, has taken
      appropriate refuge in the snug precincts of Gatton. There let it wither!
    </p>
    <p>
      The verdicts of my Juries require no other vindication than a faithful
      recital of the grounds on which they were founded. From the period at
      which those verdicts were pronounced, and with a view to that vindication,
      I have been unremittingly employed in the collection and arrangement of
      rare and curious materials which the Solicitor-General's attack will
      induce me to extend to
    </p>

      A COMPLETE HISTORY OF PARODY.
    </h3>
    <p>
      This History I purpose to bring out, very speedily, <i>with extensive
      graphic illustrations,</i> and I flatter myself it will answer the various
      purposes of satisfying the expectations of my numerous and respectable
      subscribers&mdash;of justifying my own motives in publishing the Parodies&mdash;of
      throwing a strong light upon the presumable motives of my prosecutors in
      singling me out from my Noble and Right Honorable Fellow Parodists&mdash;of
      holding up Trial by Jury to the increased love and veneration of the
      British People&mdash;and above all, of making every calumny upon the
      verdicts of three successive, honorable, and intelligent Juries recoil
      upon the slanderer, be he who he may, that dares to asperse them. W. HONE.
